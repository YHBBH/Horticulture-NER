Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV) is a tentative member of the luteovirus group transmitted by Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii.
Five hundred twenty-three Cucumis melo L.
accessions were screened in field conditions in the south of France under severe natural inoculum pressure.
Double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were conducted to confirm the presence or absence of virus in the plants.
Several potential sources of CABYV resistance were found, most originating from India, but some from Korea and Africa.
The resistance of the most promising genotypes was confirmed in a field trial in five locations and under controlled conditions, with viruliferous Myzus persicae used to inoculate plants.
Genotypes found to be resistant were Faizabadi Phoont, 90625, PI 124112, PI 124440, PI 255478, PI 282448, and PI 414723.
