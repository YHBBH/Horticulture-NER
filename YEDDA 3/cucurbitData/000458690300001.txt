The use of grafted vegetable seedlings has been popular in many countries during recent years, and several Cucurbita species and their interspecific hybrids have been tested as rootstocks.
Graft-scion incompatibility and lower fruit quality have prevented their commercial use.
In this study, the efficacy of grafting the commercial Khassib cucumber hybrid onto various cucurbits, used as rootstocks, was examined in a greenhouse experiment.
This experiment was done in a completely randomized design with eight treatments: local landraces of bottle gourd (Ghalyani) and pumpkin (Tanbal) and commercial Cucurbita interspecific hybrids (909, 913, Ferro, 64-19, and Shintoza).
Ungrafted plants were used as controls.
Results indicated that the highest survival rates were using Ferro hybrid (94%), Cucurbita maxima (Tanbal) (92%), 64-19 and Shintoza (90%).
These results appeared to be related to the stem diameter of the rootstocks and, to a lesser extent, to the scion diameter.
Cucumber production was not improved by grafting.
The highest yield was obtained with Ferro rootstock, but it was no different compared to ungrafted plants.
A significantly lower production than the control was observed with Ghalyani (-44%), 913 (-73%) and 64-19 (-35%) rootstocks.
Total soluble solids (TSS) of fruit produced by ungrafted plants was significantly higher than the other treatments.
The highest length/diameter ratio was obtained with 909 and Ghalyani rootstocks, whereas more stocky fruit were produced by plants grafted onto Tanbal and 64-19 rootstocks.
