Cucurbits are often cultivated in rotation with Solanaceae in double-cropping systems.
Most cucurbits have been described as susceptible to root-knot nematodes (RKN) but little is known on their relative levels of susceptibility.
Because RKN species differ in rates of root invasion and reproductive traits, isolates of M.
arenaria, M.
incognita and M.
javanica were compared on five cucurbit hosts in experiments run in a climate growth chamber.
They included zucchini squash cv Amalthee, cucumber cv Dasher II, melon cv Pistolero, pumpkin cv Totanera and watermelon cv Sugar Baby.
All cucurbits were susceptible to the three RKN isolates although M.
javanica showed higher invasion rates, faster development and higher egg production than M.
arenaria on the selected cucurbits.
Apparent differences among cucurbits were primarily due to root invasion rates and formation of egg masses.
Both Cucumis species (cucumber and melon) were better hosts for nematode invasion and reproduction than zucchini squash, followed by watermelon.
Large invasion rates followed by small reproduction traits were linked to M.
incognita on zucchini squash.
Reduced invasion rates and egg mass formation along with delayed early development were shown on watermelon.
