   Since 1999 emerging (EM) strains of Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) have been detected in cucurbit crops of southeastern France probably as a result of recent introductions Population genetic approaches were used to study the structure of EM isolates in southeastern France and to identify factors involved in their spatial distribution A population clustering method (SAMOVA) and a maximum difference algorithm (Monmonier s algorithm) were combined to visualize and quantify barriers to gene flow between populations Both methods yielded similar results and two main barriers were identified A North/South oriented barrier may be related to physical obstacles to gene flow (Rhone River presence of an area with few cucurbit crops) Although the barrier was very strong some crossing events were detected A second barrier oriented Northwest to Southeast was not correlated with obvious geographical features The two methods used here are complementary and confirm the limited spread of WMV EM isolates This approach can be useful in epidemiology studies to characterize the structure of viral populations and identify barriers to gene flow
