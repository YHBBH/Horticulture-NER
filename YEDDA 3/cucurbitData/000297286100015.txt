A field experiment was conducted with a view to understand the fruit infestation rate by fruit fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae on ash gourd, ridge gourd, sweet gourd, bitter gourd and snake gourd, and life history of the fly on these cucurbitaceous crops were studied in laboratory condition.
The highest (71.5%) and lowest (21.0%) fruit infestation rate were observed on sweet gourd and ridge gourd, respectively and the results were statistically different.
Life history parameters indicated that the pre-mating durations of the flies were found 2.5 to 4.5 days.
The highest fecundity and hatching rate were observed on sweet gourd (56.2 female(-1) and 53.5%) and that were lowest on ridge gourd (36.7 female(-1) and 34.8%).
Incubation periods varied from 18.3 to 25.0 hours and the shortest period was found on sweet gourd.
Pre-oviposition, oviposition, larval and pupal periods, and adult male and female longevity varied from 10.8 to 15.7, 5.5 to 9.5, 11.3 to 15.3, 7.3 to 10.5, 11.3 to 17.3 and 15.0 to 20.8 days, respectively.
The highest infestation rate while shortest premating, pre-oviposition, incubation, larval and pupal periods on sweet gourd indicated that this plant is the most favorable host for B.
cucurbitae among the studied crops.
