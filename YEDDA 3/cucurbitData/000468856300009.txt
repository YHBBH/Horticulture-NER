Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), an emerging tobamovirus, has caused serious disease outbreaks to cucurbit crops in several countries, including the United States.
Although CGMMV is seed borne, the mechanism of its transmission from a contaminated seed to germinating seedling is still not fully understood, and the most suitable seed health assay method has not been well established.
To evaluate the mechanism of seed transmissibility, using highly contaminated watermelon seeds collected from CGMMV-infected experimental plants, bioassays were conducted in a greenhouse through seedling grow-out and by mechanical inoculation.
Through natural seedling grow-out, we did not observe seed transmission of CGMMV to germinating seedlings.
However, efficient transmission of CGMMV was observed using bioassays on melon plants through mechanical inoculation of seed extract prepared from CGMMV-contaminated seeds.
Understanding the seed borne property and the ease of mechanical transmission of CGMMV from a contaminated seed to seedling is an important finding.
In comparative evaluation of various laboratory techniques for seed health assays, we found that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and loop-mediated isothermal amplification were the most sensitive and reliable methods to detect CGMMV on cucurbit seeds.
Because CGMMV is a seed borne and highly contagious virus, a new infection might not result in a natural seedling grow-out; it could occur through mechanical transmission from contaminated seeds.
Therefore, a sensitive seed health test is necessary to ensure CGMMV-free seed lots are used for planting.
