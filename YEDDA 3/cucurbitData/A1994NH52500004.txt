 We examined the reactions of Cucurbita spp to Fusarium root rot by evaluating disease severity.
Cucurbit plants exhibited different susceptibilities to isolates of Fusarium solani f sp cucurbitae race 1.
Cultivars 'Suzunari-nishiki' and 'Miyako' of Cucurbita maxima were more susceptible than C pepo 'Zam Squash' and C moschata 'Yashiro-yon-go'.
The aggressiveness of the isolates to cucurbits also varied.
Perithecia were formed in some dual cultures between field isolates.
All perithecia were fertile.
The possibilities for the emergence of new races or virulent strains are discussed.
