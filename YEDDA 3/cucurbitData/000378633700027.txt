Attention to off-season vegetables production has led extension new methods such as fruit vegetable grafting.
In order to study the quality and quantity characters of grafted cucumber seedlings on different rootstocks this experiment was conducted in Agriculture & natural resources research centre of Isfahan, during 2002-2004.
Scion cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.
'Soltan') was grafted onto six different rootstocks namely: Cucurbita ficifolia Bouche 'Fig leaf gourd', Cucurbita pepo 'Mosamaii', Cucumis melo L.
var.
flexuosus 'Chanbar', Cucumis melo L.
var.
reticulates 'Talebi', Cucumis sativus L.
'Dastgerdi' and Citrullus lanatus 'Watermelon', and non-grafted cucumber 'Soltan' as control.
Results showed that early flowering (10 day) and precocity (5 day) was higher than rootstock on 'Mosamaii'.
The fruit yield of 'Fig leaf gourd', 'Mosamaii', non-grafted control 'Soltan', 'Talebi', 'Chanbar', 'Dastgerdi' and 'Watermelon', were 3.1, 2.3, 1.8, 1.6, 1.5, 0.9 and 0.4 (kg/plant), respectively.
Survival rate of rootstocks were 88, 69, 49, 42, 27 and 18% for 'Mosamaii', 'Fig leaf gourd', 'Chanbar', 'Talebi', 'Dastgerdi' and 'Watermelon', respectively.
Grafting system in this study with cucurbit rootstocks were limited by fruit quality and should be carried out carefully.
The overall results of this experiment shows that the most suitable rootstocks for grafting were pumpkin 'Fig leaf gourd' and squash 'Mosamaii'.
