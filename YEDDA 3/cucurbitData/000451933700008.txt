Complete genome sequences of 22 isolates of Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), collected from melon plants showing yellowing symptom in Korea during the years 2013-2014, were determined and compared with previously reported CABYV genome sequences.
The complete genomes were found to be 5,680-5,684 nucleotides in length and to encode six open reading frames (ORFs) that are separated into two regions by a non-coding internal region (IR) of 199 nucleotides.
Their genomic organization is typical of the genus Polerovirus.
Based on phylogenetic analyses of complete nucleotide (nt) sequences, CABYV isolates were divided into four groups: Asian, Mediterranean, Taiwanese, and R groups.
The Korean CABYV isolates clustered with the Asian group with > 94% nt sequence identity.
In contrast, the Korean CABYV isolates shared 87-89% sequence identities with the Mediterranean group, 88% with the Taiwanese group, 81-84% with the CABYV-R group, and 72% with another polerovirus, M..
Recombination analyses identified 24 recombination events (12 different recombination types) in the analyzed CABYV population.
In the Korean CABYV isolates, four recombination types were detected from eight isolates.
Two recombination types were detected in the IR and P3-P5 regions, respectively, which have been reported as hotspots for recombination of CABYV.
This result suggests that recombination is an important evolutionary force in the genetic diversification of CABYV populations.
