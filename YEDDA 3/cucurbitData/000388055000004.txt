The Acidovorax genus belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum, and comprises species that possess a variety of lifestyles, with its members inhabiting different environments, including soil, water and interactions with eukaryotic organisms.
In the present chapter, we focus on Acidovorax species that are pathogenic on plants.
Acidovorax species are able to cause disease to a variety of agriculturally and economically important crops.
Moreover, some diseases caused by Acidovorax strains have been spreading worldwide in recent years and their importance is substantially increasing.
One example is seedling blight and bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbit crops caused by Acidovorax citrulli, a disease that was barely known until the late 1980s' and today is one of the most serious threats to the cucurbit industry worldwide.
Here we summarize taxonomical aspects of plant-pathogenic species of Acidovorax and describe major diseases caused by members of this genus, with emphasis on their epidemiology, control and basic aspects of pathogenesis and plant pathogen interactions.
