Plot size and number of replications were evaluated for watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)] over a 3-year period.
Four different methods were used, including plotting basic unit plots against changes in CVS, Hatheway's method for detecting a true difference as a percent of the mean with a 20% threshold, Bartlett's homogeneity of variance test, and computed least significant differences (LSDS).
An initial evaluation was done in a trial with several varieties.
Plotting CV against number of basic units using plots with different watermelon varieties suggests a plot size of approximate to 7 basic units (1 basic unit = 3.34 m(2)).
With a single variety and basic units of 6.69 m(2) for inside rows, the plot size was approximate to 4 basic units and for the outside row 5 basic units.
With plot sizes of 2.23 m(2), the number of basic units per plot was estimated at approximate to 5 basic units.
Bartlett's test suggests larger basic unit plot sizes of 14 to 20 with a 3.34-m(2) basic unit size with multiple varieties.
With a single variety, 4 to 8 basic unit plot sizes are required with 6.69-m(2) basic unit size.
Results were unreliable with 2.23-m(2) plot sizes using Bartlett's test.
Computed LSDS, which were 5% of the mean or less, could be achieved with plots sizes of 10 basic units and five replications with 3.34-m(2) basic unit plots and using multiple varieties.
Other combinations meeting these criteria included 14 basic unit plots and two or three replications.
With a 6.69-m(2) basic unit size, plots of 6 basic units and four replications would meet the 5% criteria.
Finally, with the 2.23-m(2) basic unit size, a plot size of 8 basic units and three replications would result in an LSD of 5% of the mean.
Results with Hatheway's method were similar to plots of basic units against CV.
Hatheway's method also has an estimate of number of replications and with 3.34-m(2) basic unit, the 20% threshold of detecting true differences occurred with 10 to 14 basic units and four replications.
For fruit size, firmness, and soluble solids, the basic unit plot sizes ranged from 5 to 7.
Plot size estimates were larger with 6.69 m(2) compared with 2.23 m(2) for fruit characteristics.
