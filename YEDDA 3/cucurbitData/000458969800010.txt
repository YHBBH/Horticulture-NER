Trichosanthes is the largest genus of the family Cucurbitaceae.
Its center of diversity exists in southern and eastern Asia from India to Taiwan, The Philippines, Japan, and Australia, Fiji, and Pacific Islands.
Two species, T.
cucumerina (snake gourd) and T.
dioica (pointed gourd), are widely cultivated in tropical regions, mainly for the culinary use of their immature fruit.
The fruit of these two species are good sources of minerals and dietary fiber.
Despite their economic importance and nutritive values, not much effort has been invested toward genetic improvement of these crops.
Only recently efforts have been directed toward systematic improvement strategies of these crops in India.
