 Oxyfluorfen (0.28, 0.42, 0.56, and 0.84 kg ai ha-1) under clear polyethylene film was evaluated for weed control, crop injury, and effects on yields in transplanted muskmelon, cucumber, and summer squash.
 Numerous narrowleaf and broadleaf weeds were effectively suppressed by 0.42 ha-1 of oxyfluorfen.
 Crop injury, occuring soon after transplanting, was reported in New York and North Carolina.
 Injury was usually transient, and injured crops frequently grew more vigorously than those grown on treated black polyethylene mulch.
Muskmelons were consistently the most tolerant of the three crops.
At high rates, yields of squash and cucumber in 1988 were reduced in New York and North Carolina, respectively.
 In greenhouse studies, positioning the cotyledons under the polythene film caused greater injury in all three crops than when cotyledons remained above the plastic.
