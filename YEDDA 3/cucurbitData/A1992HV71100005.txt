The striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum (F.), and the spotted cucumber beetle, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber, are important pests of cucurbits throughout Missouri.
A study was conducted that examined the effects of a black plastic mulch on the soil and plant distributions of immature and adult cucumber beetles.
Muskmelon plants were subjected to one of three treatments: mulch and herbicide, herbicide, or untreated (control).
The presence of a black plastic mulch significantly reduced the number of beetle eggs and larvae found within the top 5 cm of soil around plants.
At greater soil depths, there were no differences in egg and larval densities among treatments.
Adult cucumber beetles were most often found on the flowers of plants in all treatments.
