Phytophthora blight is a destructive disease of cucurbits affecting the fruit, leaves, crown, and/or roots.
Ten cucurbit PIs with known partial resistance to Phytophthora capsici root and crown rot were evaluated for resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot.
Unwounded fruit from field-grown plants of Cucurbita moschata and C.
pepo were inoculated in a controlled environment at 7 to 10 or 21 to 24 days post-pollination (dpp) with virulent P.
capsici isolates to examine the effect of fruit age on disease development.
Inoculated fruit were rated for lesion area and pathogen mycelial growth 7 days post-inoculation (dpi); fruit length, diameter, and pericarp thickness were also rated.
Two C.
pepo accessions (PI 169417 and PI 181761) had significant resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot at both 7 to 10 dpp and 21 to 24 dpp.
All accessions evaluated displayed reduced disease susceptibility as the fruit aged.
