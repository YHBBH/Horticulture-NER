Interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata)is a well-known cucurbit rootstock for controlling soilborne diseases and improving abiotic stress tolerance.
However, reduced fruit quality has been reported on certain melon (Cucumis melo) cultivars when grafted with squash rootstocks.
In this study, a field experiment was designed to explore fruit development and quality attributes of galia melon 'Arava' by grafting with hybrid squash rootstock 'Strong Tosa'.
Grafted plants with 'Strong Tosa' showed delayed anthesis of female flowers by days, but harvest dates were unaffected compared with non- and self-grafted 'Arava' plants.
Early and total yields were not significantly different between grafted and nongrafted plants.
Grafted plants with 'Strong Tosa' rootstock exhibited accelerated fruit development and greater vegetative growth.
During the harvest period, of grafted plants with 'Strong Tosa' wilted, which was determined as nonpathogenic.
Grafting with 'Strong Tosa' rootstock resulted in reduced fruit total soluble solids (TSS) and consumer rated sensory properties.
