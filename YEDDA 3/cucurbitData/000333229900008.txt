Sex expression is an important trait in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), in which monoecious, andromonoecious, and trimonoecious forms are present.
The andromonoecious trait is highly undesirable in watermelon breeding programs because it would require emasculation during hybrid development.
In contrast to other cucurbits such as melon (Cucumis melo) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) in which the genes involved in sex expression are well described and have been cloned, only the inheritance of the a gene associated with the andromonoecious trait has been described in watermelon.
We used an intersubspecific C.
lanatus var.
lanatus x C.
lanatus var.
citroides F-2 population to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with percent male (%M), percent female (%F), percent hermaphrodite (%HM), and percent female of pistillate [%F/P (female hermaphrodite)] flowers.
Four chromosomal regions were identified that were associated with sex expression in watermelon.
Major QTL for %F, %HM, and %F/P were colocalized on linkage group 11A and explained 31.3% to 37.7% of the phenotypic variation observed for the three traits.
These QTL are suggested to be the location of the a gene in watermelon.
Markers linked to two of the four QTL identified were located within 1 Mb of a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) gene on the watermelon draft genome.
ACS genes play a key role in sex expression in melon and cucumber and these genes are therefore candidate genes for further studies to elucidate this trait in another economically important cucurbit crop.
The QTL and candidate genes identified in the present study lay the foundation for marker-assisted selection for sex expression traits in watermelon.
