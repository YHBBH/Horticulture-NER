Mating type of Sphacrorheca fuliginea isolates was determined on summer squash leaves in detached leaf culture.
Both mating types were found in all eight states examined (Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia) and in 18 of the 27 fields examined in 1993 and 1994; therefore, the absence of one mating type is not the sole explanation for the rare sightings of cleistothecia in most areas of the United States.
Cleistothecia were found on leaves collected in Michigan, indicating that both mating types also were present in this state.
One mating type occurred more frequently (greater than or equal to 70% of the isolates tested) in 15 of these 18 fields.
In 1993, 82% of the 132 isolates tested belonged to MAT1-2; whereas in 1994, only 31% of 155 isolates were A MAT1-2.
The frequencies of isolates resistant to triadimefon (50 mu g/ml) were 0 and 63% for MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, respectively, in 1993 and 25 and 62%, respectively, in 1994.
Triadimefon-resistant isolates of each mating type were found in the same fields in California, Georgia, and Texas in 1994.
All isolates shared identical alleles at the mating incompatibility locus.
This provides strong evidence that S.
fuliginea does not possess multiple alleles at the single mating locus.
