Plant disease resistance (R) proteins that confer resistance to viruses recognize viral gene products with diverse functions, including viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs).
The P0 protein from poleroviruses is a VSR that targets the ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) protein for degradation, thereby disrupting RNA silencing and antiviral defences.
Here, we report resistance against poleroviruses in Nicotiana glutinosa directed against Turnip yellows virus (TuYV) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV).
The P0 proteins from TuYV (P0(Tu)), PLRV (P0(PL)) and Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (P0(CA)) were found to elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) in N.glutinosa accession TW59, whereas other accessions recognized P0(PL) only.
Genetic analysis showed that recognition of P0(Tu) by a resistance gene designated RPO1 (Resistance to POleroviruses 1) is inherited as a dominant allele.
Expression of P0 from a Potato virus X (PVX) expression vector transferred recognition to the recombinant virus on plants expressing RPO1, supporting P0 as the unique Polerovirus factor eliciting resistance.
The induction of HR required a functional P0 protein, as P0(Tu) mutants with substitutions in the F-box motif that abolished VSR activity were unable to elicit HR.
We surmised that the broad P0 recognition seen in TW59 and the requirement for the F-box protein motif could indicate detection of P0-induced AGO1 degradation and disruption of RNA silencing; however, other viral silencing suppressors, including the PVX P25 that also causes AGO1 degradation, failed to elicit HR in N.glutinosa.
Investigation of P0 elicitation of RPO1 could provide insight into P0 activities within the cell that trigger resistance.
