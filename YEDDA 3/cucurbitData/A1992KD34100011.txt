Since 1988, a yellowing disease of melon, cucumber and zucchini squash has been frequently observed in summer and autumn crops in France.
Infected plants show yellowing and thickening of the older leaves; symptom intensity differs depending upon cultivar and season, and can be easily overlooked when plants are already infected by mosaic-inducing viruses or other pathogens.
The disease is associated with the presence of a virus with spherical particles c.
25 nm in diameter, which is readily transmitted in a persistent manner by the aphids Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii, but not mechanically.
Serological analysis, nucleic-acid-hybridization experiments and host-range studies indicate that the virus is distantly related to, but distinct from, beet western yellows virus (BWYV).
We propose to name this virus cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), and to consider it as a tentative new member of the luteovirus group.
CABYV was found to reduce significantly the yields of melon and cucumber by decreasing the number of fruit per plant but not by altering the fruit shape or quality.
Preliminary investigations of the epidemiology of CABYV indicate that the virus is common in weeds and in cultivated cucurbits.
CABYV was frequently detected in various regions of France, suggesting that it is one of the most prevalent viruses infecting cucurbits in this country.
