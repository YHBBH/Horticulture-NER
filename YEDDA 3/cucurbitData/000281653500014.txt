The specificity of ascospore germination of Monosporascus cannonballus in the rhizosphere of 26 species/cultivars of plants belonging to eight families and 14 genera was examined.
Results showed that ascospore germination occurred only in the rhizosphere of genera, species and cultivars belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family.
Differences between the number of ascospore germlings attached to roots of the various cucurbit species/cultivars suggests qualitative and/or quantitative differences in a specific root exudate(s) which are presumably associated with the induction of ascospore germination.
