P>Melon yellow spot virus (MYSV), a member of the genus Tospovirus, is a serious thrips-transmitted virus of cucurbits in Japan.
Resistant cultivars provide an effective means for reducing the impact of the disease; however, no MYSV-resistant cucumber has been reported.
Susceptibilities of 398 cucumber accessions originating from 26 countries were evaluated by mechanical inoculation of MYSV.
Thirteen accessions from South Asia, South East Asia and unknown origin had low disease severity indices (DSIs), and 10 of them showed no necrotic lesions on inoculated leaves.
No or little positive reaction was detected by DAS-ELISA analysis of inoculated leaves of these accessions.
27028930 showed resistance to a melon isolate (MYSV-S) of MYSV, and 'Yamakyuri-1' showed moderate resistance to a cucumber isolate (FuCu05P).
