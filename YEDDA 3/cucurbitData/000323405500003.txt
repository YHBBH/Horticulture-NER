The responses of a diverse group of vining cucurbits to inoculation with Squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV) were determined.
For the first time, Cucurbita maxima, Cucumis dipsaceus, and Cucumis metuliferus were observed to develop necrosis and plant death similar to the SqVYV-induced vine decline in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var.
lanatus).
The majority of cucurbits inoculated, however, either exhibited no symptoms of infection, or developed relatively mild symptoms such as vein yellowing of upper, noninoculated leaves.
All inoculated plants were sectioned and tested for the presence of SqVYV.
The virus was widely distributed in mature, fruit-bearing cucurbits with over 72% of plant sections testing positive for SqVYV by tissue-blot and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Plants of several cucurbits, including a wild citron (Citrullus lanatus var.
citroides), were symptomless and had a decreased frequency of virus infection of vine segments compared to susceptible vining cucurbits, indicating a higher level of resistance.
However, no significant relationship between the frequency of infection or virus distribution within plants and the symptom response was observed.
These results demonstrate that a diverse group of cucurbits may decline when infected with SqVYV, and suggest that widespread distribution of virus within the plant is not the sole cause of decline.
