Triazole fungicides, which are sterol demethylation inhibitors, have become the primary systemic fungicides applied to cucurbits to control gummy stem blight caused by Didymella bryoniae.
Isolates of D.
bryoniae from South Carolina that were never exposed to tebuconazole or exposed for several years were tested for sensitivity to tebuconazole and difenoconazole.
Colony diameters, percentage germination of ascospores and conidia, and germ tube lengths were measured when isolates were grown on agar amended with 0.1010.0mg/l tebuconazole and 0.011.0mg/l difenoconazole.
All 147 isolates tested were sensitive to tebuconazole and difenoconazole with mean EC50 values of 0.41 and 0.054mg/l, respectively.
Ascospore germination was greater than conidia germination on fungicide-amended agar.
Although the length of germ tubes arising from both spore types was reduced by both fungicides, the reduction was greater for ascospore germ tubes than for conidia germ tubes.
Because many watermelon growers rotate crops among fields every two years, local populations of D.
bryoniae have not been exposed repeatedly to tebuconazole.
In addition, growers often apply a rotation of systemic and contact fungicides.
Thus, despite exposure to tebuconazole for up to nine years, isolates of D.
bryoniae from South Carolina remain sensitive to triazole fungicides.
