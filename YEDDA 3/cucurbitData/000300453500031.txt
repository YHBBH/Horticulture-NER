Suboptimal root zone temperature (14A degrees C) was imposed on chilling-sensitive cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and chilling-tolerant figleaf gourd (Cucurbita ficifolia Bouch,) plants.
Exposure of roots to low temperature for up to 10 days caused a strong growth inhibition in cucumber compared with figleaf gourd.
Physiological analysis showed that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion was significantly induced in cucumber plants as fast as 1 day after low root zone temperature treatment.
In addition to the significant induction of antioxidant superoxide dismutase activity, low root zone temperature also increased the mitochondrial electron transport allocated to alternative pathway while decreased cytochrome pathway salicylhydroxamic acid-resistant respiration.
However, these defense responses could not compensate for the ROS production, resulting in membrane lipid peroxidation and loss of root cell viability in the low root zone temperature treated cucumber roots.
In contrast, 14A degrees C root zone temperature had no significant effects on figleaf gourd plant growth, antioxidant enzymes, ROS levels and alternative respiratory pathway.
Hence, difference in ROS metabolism would be associated with the remarkable difference in adaptability of cucumber and figleaf gourd plants in response to suboptimal root zone temperature condition.
