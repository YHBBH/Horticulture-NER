 The cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus (CABYV) is a new tentative member of the luteovirus group which is transmitted persistently by Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii.
   In muskmelon plants, mixed infection with CABYV and zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) induced an increase in CABYV concentration estimated by double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), which was maximum after 3 weeks of co-infection.
   Assays, conducted with other cucurbit hosts and sap-transmissible viruses showed that a similar increase occurred with most of the potyviruses tested.
However, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and squash mosaic virus (SqMV) were inefficient (or less efficient than potyviruses) in increasing CABYV concentration.
   Aphid transmission experiments were conducted to check whether increased virus multiplication could either enhance transmission rates or modify the mode of CABYV acquisition by aphids.
However, when A.
gossypii was used, no increases in CABYV transmissibility nor in its acquisition mode were detected.
