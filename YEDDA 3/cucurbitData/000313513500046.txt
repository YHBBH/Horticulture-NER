Effects of Na2CO3 stress (0, 30, 60 and 90 mmol.L-1) on the chlorophyll contents, membrane permeability and antioxidant enzyme activities of the two Cucurbit spp.
rootstocks: C.
ficifolia Bouch.
and C.
moschata Duch.
('Chuandilong') were investigated by sand culture.
The results were as follows: the chlorophyll a (chl.
a), chlorophyll b (chl.
b) and total chlorophyll (chl.
t) of two rootstocks all increased in low Na2CO3 concentration (0-30 mmol.L-1), and then decreased from 30 to 90 mmol.L-1.
Meanwhile, the membrane permeability, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, proline contents, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) of two rootstocks increased with Na2CO3 stress, and the increase was more significantly in 'Chuandilong' than C.
ficifolia Bouch.
