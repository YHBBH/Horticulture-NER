This study was conducted to establish an efficient screening system to identify melon resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f.
sp.
melonis.
F.
oyxsporum f.
sp.
melonis GR was isolated from infected melon plants collected at Goryeong and identified as F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
melonis based on morphological characteristics, molecular analyses, and host-specificity tests on cucurbits including melon, oriental melon, cucumber, and watermelon.
In addition, the GR isolate was determined as race 1 based on resistance responses of melon differentials to the fungus.
To select optimized medium for mass production of inoculum of F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
melonis GR, six media were tested.
The fungus produced the most spores (microconidia) in V8-juice broth.
Resistance degrees to the GR isolate of 22 commercial melon cultivars and 6 rootstocks for melon plants were investigated.
All tested rootstocks showed no symptoms of Fusarium wilt Among the tested melon cultivars, only three cultivars were susceptible and the other cultivars displayed moderate to high resistance to the GR isolate.
For further study, six melon cultivars (Redqueen, Summercool, Superseji, Asiapapaya, Eolukpapaya, and Asiahwanggeum) showing different degrees of resistance to the fungus were selected.
The development of Fusarium wilt on the cultivars was tested according to several conditions such as plant growth stage, root wounding, dipping period of roots in spore suspension, inoculum concentration, and incubation temperature to develop the disease.
On the basis of the test results, we suggest that an efficient screening method for melon plants resistant to F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
melonis is to remove soil from roots of seven-day-old melon seedlings, to dip the seedlings without cutting.
in spore suspension of 3 x 10(5) conidia/mL for 30 min, to transplant the inoculated seedlings to plastic pots with horticulture nursery media, and then to cultivate the plants in a growth room at 25 to 28 degrees C for about 3 weeks with 12-hour light per day.
