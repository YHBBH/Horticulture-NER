Several surveys were carried out during three consecutive years (2007-2009) on the major crops cultivated in different districts of Nepal, in order to verify the possible presence of diseases caused by bacteria.
The monitoring was carried out twice a year, in spring and autumn.
During the survey we observed a wide range of bacterial diseases of plants.
Most of the diseases were observed for the first time while others had been reported previously.
Among the bacterial diseases observed for the first time, the most important were olive knot, bacterial speck of tomato, crown gall of plum, soft rot of potato, bacterial spot of tomato, and bacterial spot of cucurbits.
Outbreaks of black rot were observed in different Brassica fields.
Among the other widespread diseases, the most important were bacterial leaf blight of rice, citrus canker, citrus greening, bacterial wilt of tomato, potato, pepper, and eggplant, halo blight of bean, and bacterial pustule and bacterial blight of soybean.
Attempts to explore the source of introduction of these pathogens, their spread, and yield losses caused were made together with recommendations for control measures.
