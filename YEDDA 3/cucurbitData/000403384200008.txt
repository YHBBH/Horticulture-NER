A cotyledon bioassay was conducted to assess the activity of isopyrazam against Podosphaera xanthii (Castagne) U.
Braun & N.
Shishkoff, causal agent of cucumber powdery mildew.
Results showed that isopyrazam has protective and curative activity against P.
xanthii, with EC50 values of 0.04 and 0.05 mg liter(-1), respectively.
These activities are higher than those for hexaconazole, difenoconazole, pyraclostrobin, kresoxim-methyl, and azoxystrobin, fungicides currently used against cucumber powdery mildew.
Isopyrazam at 0.5 mg liter(-1) damaged conidiophores.
Results of inoculation tests in greenhouse pots indicate that isopyrazam demonstrates a level of systemic movement in cucumber plants, especially regarding translaminar and transverse translocation.
Efficacy following translaminar and transverse trans locations on cotyledons and leaves treated with 60 mg liter(-1) was 94.40% and 88.96%, and 95.26% and 82.83%, respectively.
In addition, isopyrazam at 60 mg liter(-1) exhibited a long duration of efficacy against cucumber powdery mildew, almost 2 to 3 weeks longer than that of triazoles and strobilurins.
Similar trends in residual durations were observed during 2014 and 2015 greenhouse trials.
Isopyrazam at 30 and 60 a.i.g ha(-1) provided efficacy ranging from 83.27 to 90.83% 20 days following treatment.
In conclusion, isopyrazam has translaminar and transverse translocation in cucumber leaves, and long duration of activity against cucumber powdery mildew.
