The sixty-four cultivars of four Cucurbita species (C.
argyrosperma, C.
maxima, C.
moschata, C.
pepo) were tested for field resistance to powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe cichoracearum.
 C.
pepo and C.
maxima cvs.
were mostly highly susceptible.
 There were substantial differences among the seven groups of C.
pepo in field resistance to powdery mildew.
 The least susceptible C.
pepo cultivars occurred in acorn and scallop groups.
 A low level of susceptibility showed cultivars of C.
argyrosperma and C.
moschata.
