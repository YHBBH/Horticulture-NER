partially resistant cultivar.
We conclud Cucurbit powdery mildew (CPM) is one of the most important plant protection problems in Swedish cucumber production.
CPM fungi have developed resistance to the commonly used fungicide (Imazalil) rendering its current use less effective.
We therefore screened a selection of alternative products, evaluating their ability to control CPM in seven small-scale, semi-commercial, greenhouse experiments.
Products were screened for their ability to suppress CPM on a susceptible cultivar, in 2013.
In 2015, the best treatments were tested in different combinations, in different intervals on a susceptible and a partially resistant cultivar.
The treatment that gave the best CPM control was Sakalia in combination with wetting agent Yuccah, (based on Reynoutria sachaliensis and Yucca schidigera respectively) applied at 7-day intervals.
This treatment was highly efficient on both cucumber cultivars.
Sakalia mixed with Yuccah applied at 14-day intervals had an almost equally controlling effect on CPM.
The microbial pesticides, Polyversum (Pythium oligandrum) and AQ10 (Ampelomyces quiscalis) and the fungicide Imazalil, provided no to poor control of CPM compared to control treatments.
Hortistar (Silicon) partially reduced CPM infections and was more efficient on the e that Sakalia in combination with wetting agent Yuccah could efficiently control the disease even under the severe conditions caused by artificial inoculation.
Further testing of this combination in commercial greenhouses will enable evaluation of the potential effects on yield and beneficial or pest insects.
The knowledge gained from this study can be used to develop IPM tools for commercial production systems.
