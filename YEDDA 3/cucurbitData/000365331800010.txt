Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) is one of the most important pathogens that cause significant yield losses in many cucurbit crops including cucumber (Cucumis sativus L).
ZYMV resistance in cucumber is inherited by a single recessive gene.
The purpose of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to the gene conferring ZYMV resistance in cucumber.
We developed a population of 188 F-2 plants derived from inbred cucumber lines.
Individual F-2 plants were self-pollinated to generate F-3 populations.
Ten randomly selected plants from each F-3 population were tested for ZYMV resistance.
We used a bulk segregant analysis method to identify putative molecular markers linked to ZYMV resistance.
Using bulked DNA samples with parental lines and F-1, a total of 170 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP), 586 simple sequence repeat (SSR), and 308 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations were screened.
Neither polymorphic SRAP nor SSR markers were linked with ZYMV resistance.
Among the 308 AFLP primer combinations tested, an AFLP marker in the E-ACA/MCA primer combination showed significant association among parental lines, F-1, and resistant and susceptible plants.
The combination of E-ACA/M-CA was achieved on parental lines, F-1, and 188 F-2 individuals for confirmation of the marker segregation on the F-2 population.
We found that the combination of E-ACA/M-CA was linked to the zym locus with 6.91 cM.
