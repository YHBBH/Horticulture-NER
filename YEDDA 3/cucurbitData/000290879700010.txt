Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB), caused by the seedborne, gram-negative bacterium Acidovorax citrulli, is a serious threat to cucurbit seed and fruit production worldwide.
Because of the lack of effective management strategies, we investigated the efficacy of a nonpathogenic A.
citrulli strain as a biological control seed treatment for BFB.
For this study, we generated a type III secretion system mutant of A.
citrulli, AAC00-1 Delta hrcC, that was nonpathogenic on watermelon but retained its ability to colonize germinating watermelon seed.
With watermelon seed naturally infested with A.
citrulli, AAC00-1 Delta hrcC reduced BFB seedling transmission by 81.8% relative to control seed.
In comparison, another A.
citrulli antagonist, A.
avenae strain AAA 99-2, reduced BFB seedling transmission by 74.6% for seed samples from the same lot.
Additionally, when female watermelon blossoms were protected with AAC00-1 Delta hrcC and subsequently challenged with AAC00-1, the resulting seedlots displayed 8% BFB seedling transmission.
This was not significantly different than seed from blossoms protected with AAA 99-2 (4%) but significantly less than those from blossoms protected with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (36%).
These results suggest that nonpathogenic A.
citrulli has potential as a biological control seed treatment component in a comprehensive BFB management program.
