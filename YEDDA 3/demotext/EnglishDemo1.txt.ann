A US aircraft carrier and other warships did not sail towards North Korea - but went in the opposite direction, it has emerged.
The [$US#Plant*] Navy said on 8 [$April#Data*] that the [$Carl Vinson#Person*] strike group was [$travelling#Sector*] to the Korean peninsula amid tensions over [$Pyongyang's nuclear ambitio#Disease*]ns.
Last week President Trump said an "[$armada#Virus*]" was being sent.
But the group was actually farther away over the weekend, moving through the Sunda Strait into the Indian [$Ocean#Virus*].
The [$US#Plant*] military's Pacific Command said on Tuesday that it had cancelled a port visit to Perth, but had [$completed#Method*] previously scheduled training with Australia off its [$northwest#Virus*] coast after departing Singapore on 8 [$April#Data*].
The strike group was now "proceeding to the Western Pacific as ordered".
It is not clear whether the failure to arrive was a deliberate deception, perhaps designed to frighten[$ North Korea#Disease*]'s leader [$Kim Jong-un#Person*], a change of plan or simple miscommunication, the [$BBC#Disease*]'s Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says.
Either way, [$US#Plant*] Vice-President Mike Pence was undeterred as he spoke aboard the [$US#Plant*]S Ronald Reagan - an [$aircraft#Plant*] carrier docked in Japan - during his tour of the region, vowing to "defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response".
[$North Korea#Sector*] and the [$US#Plant*] have ratcheted up tensions in recent weeks and the movement of the strike group had raised the question of a pre-emptive strike by the [$US#Plant*].
On Wednesday, Mr Pence described the country as the "most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security" in the Asia-Pacific.
His words came after the North held a show of military might in a parade over the weekend and tested another missile on Sunday, which blew up almost immediately after launch, the Pentagon said.
The [$US#Plant*] also accused[$ North Korea#Disease*] of trying to "provoke something", with [$US#Plant*] Defence Secretary James Mattis calling the test a reckless move on Tuesday.
He said the [$US#Plant*] was "working closely" with China to engage[$ North Korea#Disease*].
Pyongyang said it may test missiles on a weekly basis, and warned of "all-out war" if the [$US#Plant*] takes military action.
"If the [$US#Plant*] is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method," Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the [$BBC#Disease*] on Monday.
