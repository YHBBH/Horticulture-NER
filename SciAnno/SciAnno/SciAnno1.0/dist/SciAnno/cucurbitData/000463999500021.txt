Watermelon is the most significant, natural plant source of L-citrulline, a non-proteinaceous amino acid that benefits cardiovascular health and increases vasodilation in many tissues of the body.
Watermelon is a member of the Cucurbitaceae, which includes squash, melon, pumpkin, and cucumber.
It is possible that other cucurbits could be good sources of citrulline or of arginine, its direct precursor.
Twenty-one cultigens were evaluated in triplicate at two locations in North Carolina to estimate citrulline and arginine amounts and variation due to cultigen, replication, and environment.
Cultigens containing the highest amount of citrulline (based on LS means) in g /kg fresh weight were 'Crimson Sweet' watermelon (2.85), 'Dixielee' watermelon (2.43), casaba-type melon (0.86), mouse melon (0.64), and horned melon rind (0.45).
Additionally, mouse melon, horned melon, and bitter gourd (arils) may be interesting sources of arginine-family amino acids, perhaps because of their large seed and aril content relative to mesocarp.
