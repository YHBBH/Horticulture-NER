 Under controlled inoculation, six muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) lines were studied for resistance to eight isolates of cucurbit downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk.
and Curt.) Rostow.) originating from cucumbers (Cucumis staivus L.).
 Only line MR-1 was highly resistant with expression of race specificity and genetic heterogeneity.
 This line was also resistant to powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea (Schlecht.
ex Fr.) Poll.) under glasshouse and laboratory conditions.
