Powdery mildew caused by Podosphaera xanthii is an important disease of melon, and race 2F is the predominant race in most areas of China.
Resistance to P.
xanthii race 2F in melon K7-1 was controlled by a dominant gene, designated Pm-2F, in a 106-member population of recombinant inbred lines derived from K7-1x susceptible K7-2.
Using bulked segregant analysis with molecular markers, we have identified two polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) to determine that Pm-2F is located on linkage group II.
Comparative genomic analyses using mapped SSR markers and the cucumber genome sequence showed that the melon chromosomal region carrying Pm-2F is homologous to a 288,223 bp genomic region on cucumber chromosome (chr) 1.
The SSR markers on chr 1 of cucumber, SSR02734, SSR02733 and CS27 were found linked with Pm-2F.
Comparative mapping showed that two SSR markers (SSR02734 and CMBR8) flanked the Pm-2F locus and two nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat resistance genes were identified in the collinear region of cucumber.
A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was developed from the sequence of resistance genes and it delimits the genomic region carrying Pm-2F to 0.8 cM.
The evaluation of 165 melon accessions and 13 race differential lines showed that the newly developed CAPS (CAPS-Dde I) marker can be used as a universal marker for effective marker assisted selection in melon powdery mildew resistance breeding.
The putative resistance gene cluster provides a potential target site for further fine mapping and cloning of Pm-2F.
