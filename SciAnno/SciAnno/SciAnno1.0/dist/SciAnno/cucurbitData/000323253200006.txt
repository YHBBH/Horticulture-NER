Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is one of the important vegetable crops in the world and its production is seriously affected by apical leaf curl disease in northern India.
This paper reveals the role of cucurbits in maintaining Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) and Potato apical leaf curl (PALCD) disease in that region.
The affected plants showed severe leaf curling and stunted growth.
The begomovirus causing leaf curling and mosaic disease in cucurbits could be easily transmitted by the whitefly to potato crops and develop apical leaf curl disease in northern India.
The movement of the virus by whiteflies from cucurbits to potato and tomato is possible because of overlapping of planting and harvesting dates of these crops.
The causal virus was identified as a begomovirus on the basis of whitefly transmission, PCR, dot blot hybridization, cloning and sequencing of the coat protein gene.
The comparison of full length coat protein gene sequence homology revealed that 90% identity with the coat protein gene of ToLCNDV- [Luffa] isolate and the phylogenetic tree derived from these sequences with other selected begomoviruses formed a close cluster with ToLCNDV isolates.
The findings proved that the virus causing disease in cucurbits could easily move to tomato and potato and cause leaf curl disease naturally.
This is the first observation on the role of sponge gourd for maintenance of ToLCNDV and serving as a host for PALCD in northern India.
The findings indicate that the causal organism is a strain of ToLCNDV.
