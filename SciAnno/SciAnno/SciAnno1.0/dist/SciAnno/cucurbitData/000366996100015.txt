Cucurbit powdery mildew (CPM), a disease on field and greenhouse cucurbit crops worldwide, is caused most frequently by two obligate erysiphaceous ectoparasites (Golovinomyces orontii s.l., Podosphaera xanthii) that are highly variable in their pathogenicity and virulence.
Various independent systems of CPM race determination and denomination are used worldwide, having to date been differentiated on different cultivars or lines of melon (Cucumis melo L.).
We briefly review historical perspectives and the current state of understanding of the virulence variation of the two CPM pathogens at the pathogenic race level, their differentiation and their designation.
Furthermore, we propose for use by the international CPM research, breeding, seed and production community new tools to enhance research, communication and management of CPM.
These tools consist of five components: 1) a set of 21 differential genotypes of Cucumis melo L.
for the identification of CPM races; 2) a triple-part, septet code for meaningful, concise designation of CPM races; 3) protocols for maintaining CPM isolates and differential genotypes and for laboratory assays to examine the virulence of CPM isolates; 4) rules and principles of practical application of this system in breeding, seed production and cucurbit growing, including a proposal of a race denomination suitable for practical application; and 5) crucial activities leading to the implementation and running of new tools for CPM research and management.
The five components of this package have equal importance, forming a compact system, and none of them can be omitted.
