The efficacy of biocontrol agents (effective microorganisms (EMs1), Bacillus subtilus, and Bacillus pumilus), zinc oxide nanoparticles, castor and clove oils, as well as of a recommended fungicide (famoxadone + cymoxanil) utilised during two growing seasons under greenhouse conditions against downy mildew of cucumber were evaluated.
Furthermore, GC-MS analysis was carried out to identify the bioactive chemical components of plant origin oils (castor and clove).
The effect of these treatments on some biochemical, growth, and yield characters of cucumber was also investigated.
Famoxadone + cymoxanil was the most effective treatment in both test seasons, followed by clove oil, zinc oxide, EMs1, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilus, and castor oil.
The results showed a significant effect of all the treatments on some biochemical (chlorophyll content, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase) as well as growth and yield characters (plant height, fruit number per plant, and fruit yield) of the cucumber plants relative to control.
