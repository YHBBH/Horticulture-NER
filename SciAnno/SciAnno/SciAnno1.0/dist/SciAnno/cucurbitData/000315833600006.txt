Phytophthora capsici is an aggressive pathogen that is distributed worldwide with a broad host range infecting solanaceous, fabaceous, and cucurbitaceous crops.
Over the past two decades, increased incidence of Phytophthora blight, particularly in eastern states, has threatened production of many vegetable crops.
Cucumis melo L.
(honeydew and muskmelon), although especially susceptible to fruit rot, is also highly susceptible to crown rot.
Currently, little is known about host resistance to P.
capsici in C.
melo.
To assess crown rot resistance in C.
melo seedlings, 308 U.S.
PIs, and two commercial cultivars (Athena and Dinero) were grown under greenhouse conditions.
Seedlings with three to four true leaves were inoculated with a five-isolate zoospore suspension (1 x 104 zoospores per seedling) at the crown and monitored for 6 weeks.
All the susceptible control plants of Athena died within 7 days post-inoculation.
The majority of the PIs (281 of 308) were highly susceptible to crown rot and succumbed to the disease rapidly and had less than 20% of the plants survive.
Several PIs (PI 181748, PI 182964, and PI 273438) succumbed to crown rot earlier than the susceptible melon cultivars.
Eighty-seven PIs selected on the basis of the first screen were re-evaluated and of these PIs, 44 were less susceptible than cultivars Athena and Dinero.
Twenty-five of the 87 PIs were evaluated again and of these six PI, greater than 80% of the plants survived in the two evaluations.
Disease development was significantly slower on these PIs compared with the susceptible checks.
High levels of resistance in S-1 plants of PI 420180, PI 176936, and PI 176940 were observed, which suggests that development of resistant germplasm for use in breeding programs can be accomplished.
Further screening and careful selection within each of these PIs can provide a framework for the development of resistant germplasm for use in breeding programs.
