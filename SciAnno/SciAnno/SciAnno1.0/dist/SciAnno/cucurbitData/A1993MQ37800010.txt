Rotting muskmelon fruits commonly are associated with commercial fields that are affected by the root rot/vine decline disease syndrome found in southern Texas.
Four isolates of Fusarium solani previously shown to be either weakly pathogenic or nonpathogenic to muskmelon seedlings caused extensive rot on mechanically wounded muskmelon fruits.
Two of these isolates caused more extensive fruit rot than either F.
