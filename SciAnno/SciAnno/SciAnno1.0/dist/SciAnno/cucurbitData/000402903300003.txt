We have shown previously that the translation of Melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV, family Tombusviridae, genus Carmovirus) RNAs is controlled by a 3'-cap-independent translation enhancer (CITE), which is genetically and functionally dependent on the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E.
Here, we describe structural and functional analyses of the MNSV-Ma5 3'-CITE and its translation initiation factor partner.
We first mapped the minimal 3'-CITE (Ma5TE) to a 45-nucleotide sequence, which consists of a stem-loop structure with two internal loops, similar to other I-shaped 3'-CITEs.
UV crosslinking, followed by gel retardation assays, indicated that Ma5TE interacts in vitro with the complex formed by eIF4E1 + eIF4G(980-1159) (eIF4F(p20)), but not with each subunit alone or with eIF4E+eIF4G(1003-1092), suggesting binding either through interaction with eIF4E following a conformational change induced by its binding to eIF4G(980-1159), or through a double interaction with eIF4E and eIF4G(980-1159).
Critical residues for this interaction reside in an internal bulge of Ma5TE, so that their mutation abolished binding to eIF4E1eIF4G(1003-1092) and cap-independent translation.
We also developed an in vivo system to test the effect of mutations in eIF4E in Ma5TE-driven cap-independent translation, showing that conserved amino acids in a positively charged RNA-binding motif around amino acid position 228, implicated in eIF4E-eIF4G binding or belonging to the cap-recognition pocket, are essential for cap-independent translation controlled by Ma5TE, and thus for the multiplication of MNSV.
