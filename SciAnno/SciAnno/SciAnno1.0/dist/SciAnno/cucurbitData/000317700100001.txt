Acidovorax citrulli, the causal agent of a bacterial seedling blight and fruit blotch (BFB), has received considerable attention since its first appearance in commercial watermelon production areas in the United States in 1989.
Subsequently, it has emerged as a serious pathogen of cucurbitaceous plant species worldwide.
In the major cucurbit producing countries of the world, great emphasis has been placed on managing this potentially devastating disease.
Thus far, the most effective strategy for BFB management has been exclusion, which relies heavily on rapid and reliable pathogen detection.
This review summarises recent progress in the development of A.
citrulli detection techniques and evaluates their effectiveness as it pertains to BFB management.
