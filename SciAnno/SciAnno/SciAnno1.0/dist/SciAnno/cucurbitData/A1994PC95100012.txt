SCISIC-ACID; WATER-STRESS; HISTORY; COTTON; YIELD
AB Brushing (40 strokes per 1.5 minutes, twice daily) or moisture stress conditioning (MSC) (daily nonlethal dry-down cycles) reduced seedling growth of two cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivars in 1991 and three squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) cultivars in 1991 and 1992.
In both years, watermelon [Citrullus lanatus Thunb.
(Matsum.
& Nakai)] cultivars varied in responsiveness to brushing; brushing reduced stem length 0% to 44% over four cultivars in 1992.
MSC reduced growth of all cultivars.
Brushing increased the rate of water loss from detached leaves of cucumber, squash, and watermelon, whereas MSC decreased water loss from leaves of cucumber and squash.
In 1991, under well-watered posttransplant conditions, MSC increased the mean relative growth rate (RGR) of cucumber and watermelon transplants in the greenhouse.
Brushing increased the RGR of watermelon transplants.
In 1992, MSC increased the RGR of squash and watermelon transplants grown under posttransplant drought-stressed conditions, while brushing had no effect.
Both conditioning treatments controlled plant growth in the greenhouse without diminishing subsequent plant performance.
