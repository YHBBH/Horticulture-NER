Cucurbit downy mildew, caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis, is a major cucumber disease in the Czech Republic.
Disease prevalence, host range and disease severity were evaluated from 2001 to 2009.
The geographical distribution of P.
cubensis was assessed on ca 80-100 locations per year in two main regions of the Czech Republic (central and southern Moravia, and eastern, northern and central Bohemia).
Infection by P.
cubensis was observed primarily on cucumber (Cucumis sativus) but only on the leaves.
During the study, disease prevalence ranged from 66 to 100%.
The majority of C.
sativus crops were heavily infected at the end of the growing season (second half of August).
Generally, P.
cubensis was present at high or very high disease severity.
The loss of foliage results in the reduction in the quality and quantity of marketable yield of fruit.
Pseudoperonospora cubensis was widespread across the whole area of the Czech Republic studied.
Very rarely, infection was recorded in muskmelon (Cucumis melo) and Cucurbita moschata.
Of other pathogens, the most frequently recorded was the cucurbit powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum and Podosphaera xanthii).
