In this work, the causal agents of fungal and bacterial diseases in cucurbit plants grown in greenhouse were investigated in eleven different locations of Antalya.
Based on the surveys done in different greenhouses, causal agents were determined extensively in the stages of seedling and fruiting of Cucurbitaceae plants (melons, watermelon, cucumbers, squashes).
Melons (Cucumis melo L.) and watermelons (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.&Nakai) are eaten as fruits, whereas summer and winter squashes (Cucurbita pepo L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) are eaten as vegetables.
Fungal and bacterial pathogens of Cucurbitaceae plants grown in the province of Antalya were determined by symptomatological, pathological and microscopic tests.
Initial symptoms of bacterial infection occurred on leaves and consist of small, irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions, they become angular in shape and delimited by leaf veins.
Leaf spots and necrotic lesions, fruit spots and lesions also occurred.
Damping off and root rots (Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn.) were determined in seedlings.
Downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk and Curt.) Rostow) and powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum) were determined in melon, squashes and cucumber.
Powder mildew of cucumber is very common in nearly all cucumber-growing areas.
Botrytis cinerea ((De Bary) Whetzel) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ((Lib.) De Bary) were determined in squash.
The bacterial pathogens of Pseudomonas syringae pv.
lachrymans ((S.&B.) Y.D.&W.) on cucumber, Xanthomonas spp.
on melon, Acidovorax avenae subsp.
citrulli on watermelon.
Management practices effective for these diseases include rotation, fumigation, solarization, pathogen-free seed, treated seed, host plant resistance, sanitation, adjusting soil pH, controlling weeds and insects, and using chemical and biological fungicides and bactericides.
