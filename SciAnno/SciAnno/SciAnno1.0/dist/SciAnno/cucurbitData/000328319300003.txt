Powdery mildew caused by Podosphaera xanthii is a major disease in melon.
Here we report two Px race 1 strains named Px1A and Px1B in Xinjiang, which have different pathogenicities.
The more pathogenic Px1B made some powdery mildew resistant genes on linkage group V (LGV) lose their resistant traits.
The inheritances of resistance to Px1A and Px1B in melon Edisto47 were studied using a BC1 population derived from a cross between the resistant genotype Edisto47 and the susceptible cultivar Queen.
The resistance/susceptibility segregation ratios observed in the Px1A-inoculated BC1 population and the loci of polymorphic markers indicated that resistance to Px1A was controlled by two dominant genes.
Quantitative trait locus analysis identified two loci mapped on LGII and LGV, respectively, for powdery mildew resistance.
However, for resistance to Px1B, Edisto47 was found to bear one dominant gene.
A genetic linkage map was constructed using the Px1B-inoculated BC1 population to map the resistant gene.
Comparative genomic analyses revealed that the linkage map of Pm-Edisto47-1 was collinear with the corresponding genomic region of the melon chromosome 2.
Genetic analysis showed that Pm-Edisto47-1 was located between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers CMGA36 and SSR252089, at a genetic distance of 2.1 cM to both markers.
Synteny analysis showed that two genes named MELO3C015353 and MELO3C015354 were predicted as candidates for Edisto47-1 in this region.
