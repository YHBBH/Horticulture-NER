The oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis causes downy mildew and is a highly destructive pathogen of cucurbitaceous plants.
The distribution of P.
cubensis on cucurbits, and the damage to crops caused by it, were evaluated at 115 localities (96 in 2005, 105 in 2006, 91 in 2007) in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) from 2005 to 2007.
In the Czech Republic there are annual epidemics of P.
cubensis since 1984.
The first symptoms are usually observed in southern Moravia at the end of June and epidemics usually start by the second half of July or the beginning of August.
Natural infection has been observed only on cucumber (Cucumis sativus), other cucurbits such as Cucurbita pepo, C.
maxima, Cucumis melo remaining free of infection.
Symptoms appear only on the leaf lamina.
Most cucumber fields are destroyed by the end of growing season (second half of August).
The loss of foliage has two major economic impacts: decreased yields and lower fruit quality.
Infection was detected at the majority of localities (70-94%).
Disease prevalence was usually high or very high (e.
g.
63% in 2005 and 72% in 2007).
Fields with high or very high disease prevalence were not as widespread in the year 2006, and 30% of the fields were free of infection.
Our long-term observations indicated that there has been no substantial decline in the incidence and prevalence of the disease.
