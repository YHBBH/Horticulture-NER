During the 2009, 2010, and 2011 growing seasons, disease prevalence and severity and the host range of Pseudoperonospora cubensis, the causal agent of cucurbit downy mildew, were evaluated at more than 70 locations in two main regions of the Czech Republic.
Infection by P.
cubensis was observed primarily on Cucumis sativus, rarely on other cucurbits.
Medium to high disease-severity levels were most frequently recorded on C.
sativus.
During the years 2010 and 2011, P.
cubensis infection was also recorded on Cucumis melo, Citrullus lanatus and Cucurbita moschata.
Occurrence of P.
cubensis on C.
melo and C.
lanatus has been formerly reported from the Czech Republic, however, infection on C.
moschata was observed for the first time in the Czech Republic in 2009.
In the years 2010 and 2011, four new hosts (Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita maxima, Cucurbita ficifolia and Lagenaria siceraria) of P.
cubensis were found in the Czech Republic.
   Virulence structure and its temporal changes (2010 to 2011) were studied in populations of P.
cubensis in the Czech Republic.
Seventy P.
cubensis isolates, collected from Cucumis sativus and melo, Cucurbita maxima, pepo, and moschata, and Citrullus lanatus, were analyzed for virulence variation.
The variation of pathogen populations was expressed by the designation of pathotypes using tetrad numerical codes.
The most susceptible group of differentials was Cucumis species; in contrast, the lowest frequency of pathogenicity was recorded on Cucurbita pepo subsp.
pepo, Citrullus lanatus and Luffa cylindrica.
A high proportion of Czech P.
cubensis isolates were able to infect two cucurbit species, Benincasa hispida and Lagenaria siceraria, that are not commonly cultivated in the Czech Republic or elsewhere in Central Europe.
In this study period (2009-2011), there were substantial changes to the pathogen virulence structure in comparison with the period 2001-2008.
