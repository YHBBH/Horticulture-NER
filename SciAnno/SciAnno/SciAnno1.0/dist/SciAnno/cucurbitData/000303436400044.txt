Commercial vegetable-growing areas in the Czech Republic were surveyed for the presence of nine possible viruses on plants in the family Cucurbitaceae.
Altogether 829 different leaf samples of cucumbers, summer and winter squashes, and melons with symptoms of viral infection were collected, mainly from field grown plants in the years 2003-2009.
They originated from the main cucurbit producing areas in southern Moravia and central Bohemia, and from marginal growing regions in northern Moravia and southern Bohemia.
All samples were examined by DAS-ELISA for the presence of the common viruses and possible new invasive viruses: Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV), Melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV), Papaya ring spot virus (PRSV), Squash mosaic virus (SqMV), Watermelon mosaic 2 virus (WMV-2), Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and Zucchini yellow fleck virus (ZYFV).
Positive results were obtained for ZYMV, WMV-2, CMV, and CABYV with incidences of 46, 12, 11, and 2% of the tested samples respectively.
In some cases a complex infection was detected.
According to this study CMV is a common virus on vegetables in all growing areas of the Czech Republic.
WMV-2 was found only in southern and central Moravia, and ZYMV has spread from southern Moravia, where it was discovered in 1990, to central Moravia and the marginal cucurbit producing regions in central Bohemia and northern Moravia.
CABYV was discovered on winter squash plants in the Czech Republic in 2009 and its presence was verified by sequencing.
Aphis frangulae was proven to be its newly described vector.
Representative isolates of collected viruses have been deposited in the Virus Collection of the Crop Research Institute, Prague.
All the viruses found are transmissible by aphids.
The impact of global warming is also discussed.
