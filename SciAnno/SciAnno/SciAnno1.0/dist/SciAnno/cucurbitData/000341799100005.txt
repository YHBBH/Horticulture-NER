Fusarium wilt of watermelon, caused by the soilborne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum race 2, is a serious, widespread disease present in major watermelon-growing regions of the United States and other countries.
'Fascination,' a high yielding triploid resistant to race 1, is grown in southeastern states in fields that contain a mixture of races 1 and 2.
There is some benefit to using cultivars with race 1 resistance in such fields, even though Fascination is susceptible to Fusarium wilt caused by race 2.
Experiments in 2012 and 2013 were done in fields infested primarily with race 2 and a mixture of races 1 and 2, respectively.
Fascination was grafted onto four rootstock cultivars: bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) 'Macis' and 'Emphasis' and interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x C.
moschata) 'Strong Tosa' and 'Carnivor.' Nongrafted and self-grafted Fascination were used as susceptible control treatments.
In both experiments, mean incidence of plants with symptoms of Fusarium wilt was >= 52% in the susceptible control treatments and <= 6% on the grafted rootstocks.
Disease incidence did not differ between rootstock species or cultivars.
In both years, Fascination grafted onto Strong Tosa and Macis produced more marketable-sized fruit than the susceptible control treatments.
Grafted Emphasis and Carnivor also produced more fruit than the control treatments in 2012.
The cucurbit rootstocks suppressed Fusarium wilt caused by race 2 and increased marketable yield of triploid watermelon grown in infested soil.
