Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB), caused by Acidovorax avenae subsp.
citrulli (Aac), is a serious disease of cucurbit plants.
In 1965, It was first reported in watermelon seedlings of several plant introduction lines in Georgia.
But this pathogen attacked all of the world from the United States.
In Turkey, this pathogen has been observed for the first time in 1996.
There are a few studies with related to Aac resistance some cucurbits in the world, especially watermelon and melon.
But, there is no data on resistance of native cucurbits in Turkey.
The objective of this study is determining to resistance reactions of some cucurbits for Aac.
Totally 62 genotypes (35 melons, 23 cucumbers and 7 watermelon) and highly virulence Aac 26/11 isolate were used for resistance screening.
As a result, 7 genotypes (4 Cucumber, 3 melon) were obtained resistant and other genotypes were fined susceptible for Aac.
