 Cucurbits are important crops for both staple and dessert foods.
Past reviews have not covered insect resistance in cucurbits thoroughly, especially since much work has been done recently.
Screening methods make a large difference in the efficiency of selection for resistance to insects.
Resistance of cultigens should be evaluated using several biotypes of each insect being evaluated, and efficient test conditions with good control of environment.
If possible, laboratory tests should be used to improve the repeatability and to reduce experimental error.
Resistance to insects has been identified in cucurbits.
For example, muskmelons have been identified that have resistance to melon aphid and red pumpkin beetle.
On the other hand, resistance to pickleworm has not been identified after screening hundreds of cucumber cultigens.
Conclusions drawn on the role of cucurbitacins in insect resistance to cucurbits are not unanimous.
Studies on the genetic control of resistance in cucurbits indicate that there are at least 13 crop-insect cases where there is heritable resistance.
With greater emphasis in cucurbit breeding programmes, multiple insect resistance should be obtainable in many of the cucurbit species.
