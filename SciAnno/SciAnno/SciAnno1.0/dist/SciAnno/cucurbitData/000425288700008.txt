Host resistances in PI 197088 cucumber to downy and powdery mildew pathogens are conferred by 11 (3 with major effect) and 4 (1 major effect) QTL, respectively, and three of which are co-localized.
   The downy mildew (DM) and powdery mildew (PM) are the two most important foliar diseases of cucurbit crops worldwide.
The cucumber accession PI 197088 exhibits high-level resistances to both pathogens.
Here, we reported QTL mapping results for DM and PM resistances with 148 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between PI 197088 and the susceptible line 'Coolgreen'.
Phenotypic data on responses to natural DM and PM infection were collected in multi-year and multi-location replicated field trials.
A high-density genetic map with 2780 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genotyping-by-sequencing and 55 microsatellite markers was developed, which revealed genomic regions with segregation distortion and mis-assemblies in the '9930' cucumber draft genome.
QTL analysis identified 11 and 4 QTL for DM and PM resistances accounting for more than 73.5 and 63.0% total phenotypic variance, respectively.
Among the 11 DM resistance QTL, dm5.1, dm5.2, and dm5.3 were major-effect contributing QTL, whereas dm1.1, dm2.1, and dm6.2 conferred susceptibility.
Of the 4 QTL for PM resistance, pm5.1 was the major-effect QTL explaining 32.4% phenotypic variance and the minor-effect QTL pm6.1 contributed to disease susceptibility.
Three PM QTL, pm2.1, pm5.1, and pm6.1, were co-localized with DM QTL dm2.1, dm5.2, and dm6.1, respectively, which was consistent with the observed linkage of PM and DM resistances in PI 197088.
The genetic architecture of DM resistance in PI 197088 and another resistant line WI7120 (PI 330628) was compared, and the potential of using PI 197088 in cucumber breeding for downy and powdery mildew resistances is discussed.
