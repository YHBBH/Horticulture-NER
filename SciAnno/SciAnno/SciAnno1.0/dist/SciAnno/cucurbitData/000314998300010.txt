The use of next generation sequencing technologies applied to de novo sequencing of plant genomes has resulted in a genomic revolution that is changing the way we study plant biology.
In the framework of the MELONOMICS project (www.melonomics.upv.es), the 450 Mbp genome of melon (Cucumis melo L.) has been sequenced using a whole genome shotgun strategy with the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system.
A combination of 454 shotgun and paired-end reads with Sanger BAC end sequences have been used for the assembly of the genome.
In total, more than 22 million reads representing 17.6x of the melon genome have been sequenced and assembled.
The current melon assembly contains 361 Mb (80%) of genome sequence.
The melon genome sequence will soon become a key tool for cucurbit breeders in order to improve major traits in this species.
