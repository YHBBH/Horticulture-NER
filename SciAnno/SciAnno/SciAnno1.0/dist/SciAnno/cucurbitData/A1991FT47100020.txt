AB Fruits of four cucurbit crops, cucumber, melon, watermelon and squash, were harvested 25, 35 and 45 days past anthesis (dpa) and their seeds were extracted either immediately or extracted after 10 or 20 days of pre-extraction storage (pes).
Upon extraction, the seeds were subjected or not subjected to fermentation, washing and drying.
The effects of these procedures on germinability was examined immediately after extraction or after up to 48 months of storage.
Cucumber, melon and watermelon reached full germinability by 35 dpa, but squash required a longer period.
Fermentation and drying were important for improving germinability of immature seeds of cucumber, melon and watermelon.
Fermentation had a deleterious effect on immature squash seeds.
but drying and washing improved germinability of squash seeds.
Washing of cucumber.
melon and watermelon seeds increased the rate of germination but not the percentage.
Pre-extraction storage had a positive effect on germinability but was less effective than leaving the fruit on the vine for a comparable period of time.
The seed coat in these cucurbits completed its growth earlier than did the embryo and this probably played an important role in inhibiting germination of immature seeds.
Removal of the seed coat increased germinability of immature seeds.
Germination rate was a more sensitive measure of germinability than germination percentage.
