To develop a molecular method to identify Pseudoperonospora cubensis in cucumber leaves with signs of downy mildew, we compared the nucleotide sequences of ribosomal DNA-internal transcribed spacer, cytochrome oxidase II, and beta-tubulin genes of P.
cubensis and P.
humuli isolates.
Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distinguished P.
cubensis and P.
humuli based on variations in beta-tubulin sequences, and one specific primer set was designed for further analysis.
Real-time PCR and high resolution melting analysis showed that the primer set can be used to specifically identify P.
cubensis in cucumber leaves with downy mildew.
