Eighteen cucurbit cultivars representing five genera, nine species, and 17 horticultural types were inoculated with Didymella bryoniae in field plots in Charleston, SC, in autumn 2008, autumn 2009, and spring 2011 to determine susceptibility to gummy stem blight.
In each year, gummy stem blight cankers occurred more frequently on crowns or main stems of 'Athena' muskmelon (Cucumis melo) and 'Green Striped Cushaw' squash (Cucurbita argyrosperma) than on all other cultivars except 'Rocio' honeydew (Cucumis melo) in 2009, and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and Ojakkyo citron (Citrullus lanatus var.
citroides) in 2011.
Cucurbita moschata was highly resistant to stem cankers.
Severity of gummy stem blight on foliage was moderate to severe in autumn 2009, mild to severe in autumn 2008, and very mild in spring 2011 (due to unusually dry weather).
Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var.
lanatus) and melon were the most susceptible to foliar blight in 2008 and 2009.
In all 3 years, 'Cheese' and 'Bugle' squash (both Cucurbita moschata), and 'Judgment III' and 'Lioness' summer squash (C.
pepo) were among the cultivars with the least diseased leaf area.
C.
moschata, C.
pepo, C.
maxima, and Luffa cylindrica (smooth loofah) were significantly less susceptible to foliar blight than Cucumis melo and three Citrullus lanatus cultivars in 2008 and 2009.
This study also is the first documentation of susceptibility of Cucurbita argyrosperma to gummy stem blight.
