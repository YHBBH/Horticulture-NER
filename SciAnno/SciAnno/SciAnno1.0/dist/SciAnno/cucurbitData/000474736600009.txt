The publication presents the current state of knowledge regarding the importance of mulching in the cultivation of Cucurbitaceae (cucurbit, or gourd family) vegetables.
The intensifying climate change - mainly decreasing rainfall - combined with large-scale production of cucurbit vegetables worldwide prompt the application of methods that reduce evaporation and weed infestation.
One of the widespread methods is mulching of the soil.
The most important advantages of this treatment include the efficient use of water, the reduction in soil erosion and in the leaching of nutrients to the deeper layers.
In addition, mulching improves the physical and chemical properties of the soil, and positively affects the surrounding microclimate of the plant.
The report includes descriptions of the characteristics of various types of organic, mineral and synthetic mulches used.
The results of studies on the environmental conditions forming in mulched soil are presented.
Also, the results of research into the physico-chemical properties of mulch-covered soil are collated.
The effect of mulching on cucurbit vegetables was evaluated in terms of plant growth and development as well as fruit yield and its biological value.
The monograph also deals with the effect of mulching on weed infestation, as well as the occurrence of harmful and beneficial organisms.
