During surveys conducted in 2012-2013, viruslike symptoms of chlorotic spots with, in some cases, a necrotic centre in older leaves were observed in field- and greenhouse-grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), melon (C.melo L.) and squash (Cucurbita sp.) in the major cucurbit cultivation regions in Iran.
Leaf samples were collected and tested for the presence of Cucumber leaf spot virus (CLSV, genus Aureusvirus, family Tombusviridae) by a virus specific double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA).
CLSV was detected in four of eight surveyed provinces in melon, cucumber and squash.
When plant sap of ELISA positive samples was used to mechanically inoculate healthy squash plants, chlorotic spots with, in some cases, necrotic centres were observed on the inoculated leaves 20-25days postinoculation.
The presence of CLSV was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions using specific primers amplifying the entire coat protein gene of CLSV.
Sequence comparison with sequences available at GenBank showed 93% nucleotide sequence identity to CLSV isolates from Israel (DQ227315) and Canada (EU127904), the only CLSV coat protein sequences available.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of CLSV in Iran.
