Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) is one of the major viruses infecting cucurbit crops worldwide.
Although WMV is very common worldwide, little is known about the biological traits of WMV isolates from China.
Hence, this study aimed to characterize 11 WMV isolates infecting melon from different geographical origins in Xinjiang based on experimental hosts.
Sap inoculation of the 11 WMV isolates onto a range of 13 plant species revealed some differences compared to the WMV isolates collected from other countries.
Our results showed that, overall, there were no obvious correlations of host responses to inoculation with WMV isolates from different geographical origins.
However, isolate JS-1 caused mild mosaic on Cucurbita moschata, whereas the remaining 10 isolates were asymptomatic on this plant species.
Moreover, in Datura stramonium, isolate TYG-1 induced mosaic, whereas the remaining 10 isolates did not infect this species.
All isolates infected systemically Cucurbita pepo and Cucumis melo plants, causing severe symptoms.
All isolates did not induce any symptoms on Cucumis sativus, but the virus could be detected using RT-PCR.
Additionally, all isolates infected systemically Nicotiana tabacum plants, causing mild mosaics.
Chenopodium amaranticolor and Chenopodium quinoa reacted to all isolates by chlorotic local lesions in the inoculated leaves, and the virus was detected in the inoculated leaves using RT-PCR.
In addition, the attempts to transmit the isolates to Luffa cylindrica, Vicia faba, Phaseolus vulgaris, Vigna unguiculata or Pisum sativum failed as confirmed by negative RT-PCR.
Our results would be useful for understanding the biological variability of WMV.
