Partial resistance to downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis) and complete resistance to powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii races 1, 2 3, and 5 and Golovinonqces cichoracearum race 1) were studied using a recombinant inbred line population between 'PI 124112' (resistant to both diseases) and 'Vedrantais' (Susceptible line).
A genetic map of melon was constructed to tag these resistances with DNA markets.
Natural and artificial inoculations of Pseudoperonosporo cubensis were performed and replicated in several locations.
One major quantitative trait loci (QTL), pcXII.1.
was consistently detected among the locations and explained between 12 to 38% of the phenotypic variation for Pseudoperonospora cubensis resistance.
Eight other Pseudoperonospora cubensis resistance QTL were identified.
Artificial inoculations were performed with several strains of four races of Podosphaera xanthii and one race of G.
cichoracearum.
Two independent major genes, PmV.1 and PmXII.1, were identified and shown to be involved in the simple resistance to powdery mildew.
Three digemc epistatic interactions involving four loci were detected for two races of Podosphaera xanthii and one race of G.
cichorocearum.
Co-localization between PmV.1, resistance genes, and resistance genes homologues was observed.
Linkage between the major resistance QTL to Pseudoperonospora cubensis, pcXII.1, and one of the two resistance genes to powdery mildew, PmXII.1, was demonstrated.
