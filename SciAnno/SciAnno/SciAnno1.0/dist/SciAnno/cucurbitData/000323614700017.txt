We have investigated the effect of preharvest growing conditions on postharvest quality of cucumbers.
Cucumbers were grown at three different planting densities in four experimental greenhouses with; (1) no ventilation or heating, (2) limited ventilation only, (3) heating and some ventilation and (4) full climate control.
Cucumbers were assessed in terms of chlorophyll content, chilling injury, rots, colour, firmness and shelf life following storage at 2, 5 or 10 degrees C for up to 20 days.
Planting density did not affect postharvest quality.
However, fruit grown in the different greenhouses varied significantly.
Cucumbers grown in house (4) were consistently firmer, less prone to postharvest yellowing and had fewer rots compared to those grown under less controlled conditions.
Cucumbers from house (1) yellowed and softened soonest after harvest.
It had been suggested that cucumbers exposed to cold nights and/or hot days would be less susceptible to chilling injury, but such an effect was not observed in this trial.
The results are discussed in terms of potential improvements in returns to growers able to invest in new technology.
