Using irrigation water with a salinity level of 0.8, 2, and 5 g L(-1), the impact of saline water irrigation on the yield and quality of 2 Chinese Cucurbit species, melon (Cucumis melo cv.
Huanghe) and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus.
convar megulaspemus) were studied in Minqin Oasis, northwestern China.
Our results show that melon yields decreased as water salinity increased, just as concentrations of glutamic acid content rose, although the concentration of most amino acids did not differ significantly.
In contrast, watermelon yields decreased significantly as water salinity rose, and fruit number, fruit firmness, fruit crude protein, and essential amino acid (EAA) levels of the watermelon showed a significant increase as water salinity rose.
Salt stress on both Cucurbit species resulted in an increase in total soluble solids (TSS) and Na(+) concentrations, while Ca(+) and Cl(-) concentrations were not affected significantly.
In conclusion, our results showed that, although melon and watermelon yields were restrained by saline water irrigation, fruit quality was not influenced, such as for the fruit's amino acids.
The fact that saline water irrigation is feasible for melon and watermelon species shows that saline water is a potential irrigation water resource in arid areas of northwest China.
