Among the species of short cycle crops, with great potential to be increased within the agribusiness of the Semi-Arid Bahia, the pumpkins are an excellent alternative for production.
In this region where are found the lowest HDI of Brazil, and populations with high incidence of hypovitaminosis A, promising materials of pumpkins with high amounts of carotenoids have a chance to be good accepted and inserted into the irrigated agribusiness.
The aim of this research was to identify accessions of pumpkins from the Active Germplasm Bank (BAG) of Cucurbitaceas from Embrapa Semi-arid with high amounts of total carotenoids and vitamin A.
The amount of total carotenoids found by UV-vis spectrophotometry (445nm) in different accessions (A) ranged from 14.93mg g(-1) (A4) to 290.62mg g(-1) (A43), with average value of 366.60 +/- 31.21ig g(-1).
In the access with higher amounts of total carotenoids a percentage between 60-70 % were quantified as a- and (a) over cap -carotene showing a total value of vitamin A of 1,182.39 mu gRAE 100g(-1) (A40) and 1,828.84 mu gRAE 100g(-1) (A43).
These results demonstrate that the 48 accessions of pumpkins BAG studied show a big variation in the content of total carotenoids, and may represent some high source of vitamin A, which really increase the importance of identifying genotypes for production in large scale of lines segregant of vitamin A.
