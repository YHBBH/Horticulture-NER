AB A virus was isolated from squirting cucumber (Ecballium elaterium L.) collected in France (Alpes de Haute Provence).
After mechanical inoculation, eight species belonging to the Cucurbitaceae were found susceptible to this virus with systemic symptoms of mosaic, chlorotic spots, and fruit deformations.
The French ZYFV (ZYFV-Fr) isolate differed from the type strain in its ability to infect some differential host plants.
Elongated flexuous particles with a modal length of 752 nm were observed by electron microscopy in leaf extracts.
Cytoplasmic inclusions similar to those associated with infections by members of the potyvirus group were observed by light microscopy.
The virus was found by SDS-immunodiffusion and DAS-ELISA to be serologically related but distinct from the type strain of zucchini yellow fleck virus from Italy (ZYFV-It).
ZYFV has not yet been found in cultivated cucurbit plants in France; this virus appears to be restricted to squirting cucumbers in a few localities.
The distribution of ZYFV in France is discussed.
