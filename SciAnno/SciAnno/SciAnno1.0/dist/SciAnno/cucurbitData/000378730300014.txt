A wide range of diverse plant species are traditionally used as African leafy vegetables (ALVs) in South Africa.
Some of these species are cultivated, but most of them are wild and weedy species that are harvested from fallow lands.
These species were ignored by researchers and traders for decades.
This, however, has changed during the last decade and more interest on ALVs has been expressed from various sectors.
The increase in interest gave rise to a problem - the availability of quality seed.
Seed of landraces and cultivars of the cultivated species, like pumpkin and cowpea, can be obtained, but seed of the wild harvested species (amaranth, spider flower, jute, etc.) were difficult to obtain.
The Agricultural Research Council has maintained ALV germplasm for several years and has embarked on a process of multiplying seed.
Seed production involves the selection of suitable plant material, harvesting and seed processing.
A very good understanding of the reproductive biology of the species is also crucial to prevent contamination by other genotypes.
The seed must also be harvested at the right stage, as immature seeds fail to germinate or give a poor stand and low yields.
Seed left on the plant too long will start to shatter, thereby lowering seed yield.
To ensure viability over a long time, the seed must be stored properly.
For most ALVs, a storage temperature of 4(+/- 2)degrees C at 15-30% relative humidity is ideal.
Most seeds can safely be stored in manila envelopes, cloth or mesh bags, plastic containers or foil envelopes.
