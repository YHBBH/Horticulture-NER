During the 2007 growing season, melon (Cucumis melo) samples from the state of Guerrero in Mexico showing mosaie and other virus-like symptoms were collected for analysis.
Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained leaf-dip extracts revealed the presence of abundant virus-like particles with features characteristic of the family Bunyavirdiae.
No other viral particles were observed in these preparations.
However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) specific for the most common Tospovirus spp.
gave negative results.
Antibodies raised against purified nucleocapsids reacted specifically with the infected leaf extracts in Western blots and double-antibody sandwich ELISA.
The viral RNA was used as a template for a cDNA library, and nucleotide sequence analysis identified cloned cDNAs representing sequences corresponding to the three Tospovirus genome segments.
Sequence comparisons showed that the new virus had the highest similarity of Chrysanthemum stem necrosis virus (CSNV).
Phylogenetic analysis of two genome regions confirmed that this virus, provisionally named Melon severe mosaie virus (MeSMV), is a previously undescribed Tospovirus sp.
belonging to the "new world" clade of Tospovirus spp.
An initial survey of various cucurbit crops in various states of Mexico confirmed the widespread occurrence of this virus.
