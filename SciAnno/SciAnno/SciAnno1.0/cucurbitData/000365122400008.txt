Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus (ZLCV) is a species of the genus Tospovirus, in the family Bunyaviridae, and is transmitted by thrips (Frankliniella zucchini).
To date, ZLCV has only been reported in Brazil, where it causes a disease known as lethal chlorosis of zucchini squash.
The aim of this study was to identify additional species susceptible to ZLCV through natural infection in the field and to provide subsidies for the establishment of management strategies for the disease.
Six hundred fifty-three samples belonging to 44 plant species representing 13 families were analyzed using PTA-ELISA.
ZLCV naturally infected the following species: Cucumis anguria (1/12), Datura stramonium (1/59) and Luffa aegyptiaca (1/3).
This work provides evidence that the main natural hosts of this tospovirus are concentrated in the cucurbit family.
Presently, the management of inoculum sources can minimize the damage caused by this tospovirus.
