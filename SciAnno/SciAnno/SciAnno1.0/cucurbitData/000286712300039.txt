The effects of storage at 5, 10 or 15 degrees C for 6 months on the concentrations of starch and soluble sugar in winter squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) cultivar 'TC2A' fruits were examined.
Starch contents were significantly lower at 15 degrees C than at the other temperatures, although concentrations decreased throughout the storage period at all temperatures.
Total soluble sugar contents increased during the first 3 months of storage regardless of temperature, and decreased at 5 degrees C or 15 degrees C, but not at 10 degrees C after 6 months.
Myo-inositol and raffinose concentration patterns were more complex, and may reflect some role in regulating fruit metabolism during storage that may be important in maintaining overall squash fruit quality.
