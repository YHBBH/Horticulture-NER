In the study hami melon cultivar `Xizhoumi No.
25' was grafted onto 23 different types of cucurbit rootstocks (Cucurbita moschata, C.
maxima, C.
pepo, C.
maxima x C.
moschata, and Cucumis melo) and the self-grafted melon anvil, to study the compatibility of different rootstocks, and the effect of grafting on melon yield and quality.
In terms of compatibility, C.
maxima x C.
moschata F1 was better than the melon-self anvil, C.
moschata, and C.
pepo compared with the self-rooted control.
The differences in fruit quality and yield of grafted plants were non-significant, only few grafted cultivars slightly improved fruit quality and yield.
The self-rooted plants presented good fruit characteristics, whereas grafted plants were affected although performance varied among the treatments.
Based on graft compatibility, yield, and fruit quality assessment results, we concluded that `Jiachenzhen No.
2' (S38), `Jinanchangqingteng' (S27), `Syngenta BN224' (S30), and `Jiuquandabaizi' (S35) showed better performances than other rootstocks, whereas C.
maxima, `Nangua No.
1', C.
moschata, ` Huofenghuang' (S25), and `Zhuangshi' (S31) proved to be inferior and these rootstock are not recommended for `Xizhoumi No.
25'.
