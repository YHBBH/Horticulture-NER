A severe mosaic symptom was noticed in Basella rubra L.
during survey of cucurbit growing areas for an epidemiological study.
The infected plants were investigated for host range, physical properties, insect transmission and ELISA.
In the preliminary findings, mosaic causing virus appeared to be a strain of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and B.
rubra as a natural host of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV).
