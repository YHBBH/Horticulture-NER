P.
aphanidermatum is cosmopolitan in distribution and one of the most common plant parasitic pathogen of a number of different crop plants in warmer parts of the world.
In the present investigation, P.
aphanidermatum was isolated in very high frequency from different locations of Sindh province and from various sources.
The complete ITS region DNA sequence (ITS-1, 5.8S, ITS-2) and partial LSU (D1-D3) of P.
aphanidermatum consists of 2171 base pairs (bp).
ITS-1 consisted of 174 (6-179), 5.8S of 159 (180-338), ITS-2 of 444 (339-782) and partial LSU of 1389 (783-2171) bp.
Sequences of all our P.
aphanidermatum isolates were 99-100% identical except ML1634 which showed 98.2% similarity with ML700.
Phylogenetically, P.
aphanidermatum belong to basal clade A of Levesque & de Cock (2004).
In ITS (ITS-1 & 2 and 5.8S) sequence analysis our isolates of P.
aphanidermatum were found to be 99-100% identical to sequences of P.
aphanidermatum deposited in GenBank.
In present studies, P.
aphanidermatum was isolated from millet, banana, cucurbits, coriander, wheat, sugarcane, tomato, papaya, squash, bottle gourd, chilies, guava, betel vine, mung bean, cotton, muskmelon, brinjal, berseem, okra and radish, as well as from water canal and ponds.
