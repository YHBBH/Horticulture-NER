Gummy stem blight can develop in greenhouses on cucurbit seedlings grown as scions and rootstocks for grafting.
When diseased seedlings are cut during grafting, Stagonosporopsis spp., the fungal pathogens causing gummy stem blight, may be transferred to healthy seedlings.
The objective of this study was to evaluate efficacy of disinfectant treatments to prevent or reduce transmission during cutting and grafting.
A blade contaminated with mycelium and spores from a culture of S.
citrulli transferred the pathogen to 72%, 73%, and 55% of the second, third, and fourth seedlings, respectively, cut in sequence when 100% of the first seedlings cut were infected.
Kleengro (didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride), Physan 20 (dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride), and Virkon S (potassium peroxymonosulfate) were ineffective when sprayed onto watermelon seedlings before or after cutting hypocotyls with a contaminated blade.
Dipping a contaminated blade in 0.3% sodium hypochlorite, 0.4% Physan 20, or 70% or 95% ethanol before cutting watermelon hypocotyls significantly (P = 0.01) reduced incidence of gummy stem blight compared with water but did not prevent transmission.
Soaking a contaminated blade for 3 s in 95% ethanol, 30 s in 0.8% sodium hypochlorite, or flaming the blade after dipping in 95% ethanol, prevented transmission.
In a grafting experiment, both the watermelon scion and the interspecific hybrid squash rootstock were cut with contaminated or contaminated and treated blades before grafting.
Sterilizing a contaminated blade by flaming significantly (P = 0.01) reduced incidence of gummy stem when compared with a 1-s dip in ethanol, a 1-s dip in Physan 20, or water.
Disease incidences in these treatments were 11%, 45%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.
Using heat, ethanol, or sodium hypochlorite to disinfest cutting tools may reduce transmission of S.
citrulli during cucurbit grafting.
