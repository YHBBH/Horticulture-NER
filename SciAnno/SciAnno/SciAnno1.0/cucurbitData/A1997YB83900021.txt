Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV) was isolated in 1993 from a squash plant (Cucurbita pepo cv.
Eskandrani) showing severe leaf and fruit distortions, collected in the Gezira region (Sudan).
This isolate (ZYMV-Su) was found to be very closely serologically related if not identical to the type strain from Italy.
The host range was mostly limited to Cucurbitaceae but systemic infection was found to occur on sesame (Sesamum indicum), an important cultivated crop in Sudan.
ZYMV-Su induced mosaic symptoms on the resistant melon accession PI 414723, indicating that it belongs to pathotype 2, but did not cause wilting of melon cv.
Dobulon.
ZYMV-Su was efficiently transmitted by Myzus persicae and Aphis gossypii in a non-persistent manner.
Surveys conducted from 1993 to 1995 revealed that ZYMV occurred in the major cucurbit growing areas in Sudan, in a diversity of crops and agroecosystems.
