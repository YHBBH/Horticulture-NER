Powdery mildew of cucurbits, incited by Podosphaera xanthii (Castagne) Braun & Shishkoff (syn.
Sphaerotheca fuliginea auct.
p.p.), is an economically important foliar disease.
which is now common in watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Mastum.
& Nakai].
This disease occurs in all watermelon-growing areas and can reduce yields by up to 30%.
Finding and breeding for resistance to this disease is important to reduce dependence on fungicides and to use in combination with fungicides to limit the spread of fungicide-resistant P.
xanthii.
This is the first English report that race 2WF of P.
xanthii can infect watermelon.
It is the prevalent race of watermelon powdery mildew in Beijing.
