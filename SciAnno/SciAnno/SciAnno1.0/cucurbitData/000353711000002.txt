The Monosporascus Cannonballus is the main agent of decline roots.
However, grafting is being tested to overcome this disease.
From this perspective, the current research, aimed to screen resistant rootstocks and evaluate the compatibility of grafting watermelon Crimson Sweet.
The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse and Laboratory of Plant Pathology-II, UFERSA Mossoro, RN.
In the first, 12 genotypes were used: watermelon (TPR-02978 e TPR-04329); melon (TPR-05851 e TPR-08689) e pumpkin (TPR-06827, PES-07, PEC-01, PEM-06, PED-02, PEK-05, Shintoza e Fito), sown in pots with soil naturally infected by M.
cannonballus.
After 60 days, the roots were evaluated (DR) and (IGD) and (IA).
In the second, Crimson Sweet was used as graft and PEC-01, PES-07, PEK-05 and Shintoza as rootstocks.
The seventeenth day, were evaluated (% PEG), (AB(2)), (AC), (L), (NF), (DC), (AP), (MSPA) e (MSR).
The experimental design was randomized, using the Scott-Knott and Tukey tests SAEG (R) 9.1.
There were lower notes the (DR): TPR-02978, TPR-06827, TPR-08689, PES-07, PEC-01, PED-02, PEK-05 e Shintoza.
The (IGD): TPR-02978, TPR-08689, TPR-06827, PES-07, PEC-01, PEM-06, PED-02, PEK-05, Shintoza e Fito.
And (IA): PES-07, PEC-01 and PEK-05.
The PEC-01 had the highest (% PEG).
And the highest rates of MSPA and the MSR were obtained in PEC-01 and Shintoza.
The TPR-02978, TPR-04329, TPR-05851, TPR-08689, TPR-06827, PEM-06, PED-02, Shintoza and Fito showed susceptibility.
As for PEK-05, PES-07 and PEC-01, they were resistant to M.
cannonballus and the latter presented to the graft compatibility Crimson Sweet.
