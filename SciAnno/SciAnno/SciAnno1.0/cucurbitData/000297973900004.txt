Biotechnological methods utilized in Cucumis research - A review.

(Prague), 38: 150-158.
   Our biotechnological research on selected Cucumis species has encompassed interspecific hybridization via embryo-rescue, in vitro pollination, somatic hybridization and cytogenetics of protoplasts.
Embryo-rescue and in vitro pollination are suitable in vitro techniques for production of hybrid embryos.
These methods were tested and optimized for cucurbits.
Protoplast culture is another valuable tool for biotechnological applications, such as somatic hybridization and genetic transformation.
We study protoplast dedifferentiation not only as a biotechnological application in breeding systems, but mainly to describe mechanisms of obtaining totipotency.
Protoplasts of cucurbits were studied cytogenetically to observe changes in nuclear architecture during protoplastization and regeneration and for comparison with the expression profile obtained using cDNA-AFLP techniques and reverse transcription for the specific genes involved.
