 Phytophthora capsici was shown to be the principal species associated with Phytophthora blight of peppers and cucurbits in Ohio during 1992 and 1993.
 Both A1 (31.5%) and A2 (64.2%) compatibility types were found in peppers, and only A2 isolates were obtained from cucurbits.
 Phytophthora cactorum was recovered from two cucurbit samples.
 The Alert Phytophthora ''flow-through'' immunoassay and the Agri-Screen multiwell ELISA kit E for Phytophthora were compared for their efficacy.
 The former detected P.
capsici in pepper and cucurbit crops, and had the advantage of being rapid (10 min) and easy to perform.
 The latter was effective in detecting P.
capsici in pepper tissue, but absorbance values for healthy cucurbit tissues were relatively high.
 Agreement between ELISA and isolation of P.
capsici or P.
cactorum on semiselective medium was excellent for both kits.
 Phytophthora antigen was detected in three of seven field soils using the ELISA kit E combined with a soil organic matter extraction-concentration protocol.
