An improved method for particle Crinivirus.
Particle measurements were conducted with a CCD-72S solid state camera, which was interfaced with a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope, and analyzed using the analysis 2.1 Image Analysis Software.
In comparisons of specimen preparation methods, the leaf dip method is more representative and reproducible than the antibody capture method or preparation from purified virions.
Particle length (nm) ranges of whitefly-transmitted criniviruses are: Abutilon yellows virus (AYV), 800 to 850; Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV), 750 to 800; Lettuce chlorosis virus (LCV), 800 to 850; Lettuce infectious yellows virus (LIYV), 700 to 750; Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV), 800 to 850; and Tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV), 850 to 900.
