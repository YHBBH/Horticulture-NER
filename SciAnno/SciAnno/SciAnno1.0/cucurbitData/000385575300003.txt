Chayote (Sicyos edulis) has been identified, based on the concentrations of genetic diversity, as a cultigen native to southern Mexico and Guatemala.
However, a pan-etymological analysis from a Mesoamerican perspective with evidence available in ethnographic data concludes that Guatemala was not the place of origin.
It is more likely that chayote was first cultivated or identified in the 12th century BCE by Otomanguean speakers in Southern Mexico.
Moreover, archaeological evidence supports that the Maya cultivated chayote as early as the eighth century CE.
Chayote was not an important economic crop, nor an elite item, but it bore an important role among the nonelite.
Metaphorically, chayote is related to the feminine, it is the life container, and its hairy cleft the vulva; paired off with its opposite, the chili pepper (Capsicum), it becomes the a priori symbol of sexual union.
The " Cucurbita tree" an old designation for chayote is present in ancient Yucatec art represented as Cucurbit vines, a synecdoche for the First World Tree.
Linguistic analysis concludes that in general, local indigenous people classified the chayote as a cucurbit, organizing its subtypes according to color and presence of thorns.
