Based on the observation that Acidovorax citrulli switches from saprobic to pathogenic growth for seed-to-seedling transmission of bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits (BFB), we hypothesized that quorum sensing (QS) was involved in the regulation of this process.
Using aacI (luxI homologue) and aacR (luxR homologue) mutants of AAC00-1, we investigated the role of QS in watermelon seed colonization and seed-to-seedling transmission of BFB.
aacR and aacI mutants of AAC00-1 colonized germinating watermelon seed at wild-type levels; however, BFB seed-to-seedling transmission was affected in a cell density-dependent manner.
There were no significant differences in BFB seedling transmission between watermelon seed infiltrated with approximately 1x10(6) CFU of AAC00-1, the aacR or aacI deletion mutants (95.2, 94.9 and 98.3% BFB incidence, respectively).
In contrast, when seed inoculum was reduced to approximately 1x10(3) CFU/seed, BFB seed-to-seedling transmission declined to 34.3% for the aacI mutant, which was significantly less than the wild type (78.6%).
Interestingly, BFB seed-to-seedling transmission for the aacR mutant was not significantly different to the wild-type strain.
These data suggest that QS plays a role in regulation of genes involved in seed-to-seedling transmission of BFB.
