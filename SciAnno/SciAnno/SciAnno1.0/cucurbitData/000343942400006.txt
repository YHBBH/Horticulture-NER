Grafting is a common practice in many countries and, after the phase out of methyl bromide as fumigant, it is more widely used to control a number of diseases on solanaceous and cucurbits.
There is evidence of a pathogenic variation among some isolates of Phytophthora spp.
on solanaceous crops and on rootstocks and the development of new diseases or the re-emergence of already known pathogens such as Colletotrichum coccodes and Rhizoctonia solani.
   The susceptibility of several commercial rootstocks of bell pepper to soilborne pathogens was evaluated both, in glasshouse under artificial inoculation of P.
capsici, R.
solani, Verticillium dahliae and C.
coccodes obtained from infected bell pepper plants.
The results described in this work show that some of the rootstocks are susceptible to one or more pathogens.
The critical aspects of grafting for soilborne pathogens of bell pepper are discussed.
