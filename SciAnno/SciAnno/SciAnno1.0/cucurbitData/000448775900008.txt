Grafting of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is an established production practice that provides resistance to soilborne diseases or tolerance to abiotic stresses.
Watermelon may be grafted on several cucurbit species (interspecific grafting); however, little research exists to describe root systems of these diverse rootstocks.
A greenhouse study was conducted to compare root system morphology of nine commercially available cucurbit rootstocks, representing four species: pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima), squash (Cucurbita pepo), bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and an interspecific hybrid squash ( C.
maxima x C.
moschata).
Rootstocks were grafted with a triploid watermelon scion (`Exclamation'), and root systems were compared with nongrafted (NG) and self-grafted (SG) 'Exclamation'.
Plants were harvested destructively at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after transplant (WAT), and data were collected on scion dry weight, total root length (TRL), average root diameter, root surface area, root:shoot dry-weight ratio, root diameter class proportions, and specific root length.
For all response variables, the main effect of rootstock and rootstock species was significant (P < 0.05).
The main effect of harvest was significant (P < 0.05) for all response variables, with the exception of TRL proportion in diameter class 2.
'Ferro' rootstock produced the largest TRL and root surface area, with observed values 122% and 120% greater than the smallest root system ('Exclamation' SG), respectively.
Among rootstock species, pumpkin produced the largest TRL and root surface area, with observed values 100% and 82% greater than those of watermelon, respectively.
These results demonstrate that substantial differences exist during the initial 3 WAT in root system morphology of rootstocks and rootstock species available for watermelon grafting and that morphologic differences of root systems can be characterized using image analysis.
