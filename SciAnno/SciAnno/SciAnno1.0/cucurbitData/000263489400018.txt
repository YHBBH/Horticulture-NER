Production of polyclonal antibodies requires large amount of purified virus that can be avoided by the use of recombinant coat protein (CP).
Recombinant CP of Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) was thus used for the production of polyclonal antibodies as the virus purification from papaya tissues provides low virus yields.
CP was expressed as a fusion protein (similar to 72 kD) containing a fragment of E.
coli maltose binding protein.
Polyclonal antibodies from rabbits immunized with the fusion protein, successfully detected natural infection of PRSV in papaya and cucurbits samples collected from different locations at 1:4000 dilution in direct antigen-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
