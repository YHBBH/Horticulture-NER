Three aphid-transmitted viruses belonging to the Polerovirus genus, Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV), Beet chlorosis virus (BChV), and Beet western yellows virus (BWYV), have been described as pathogens of sugar beet.
We present the complete biological, serological, and molecular characterization of an American isolate of Beet western yellows virus (BWYV-USA), collected from yellow beet leaves.
The biological data suggested that BWYV-USA displayed a host range similar to that of BMYV, but distinct from those of BChV and the lettuce and rape isolates of Turnip yellows virus.
The complete genomic RNA sequence of BWYV-USA showed a genetic organization and expression typical of other Polerovirus members.
Comparisons of deduced amino acid sequences showed that PO and the putative replicase complex (P1-P2) of BWYV-USA are more closely related to Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV) than to BMYV, whereas alignments of P3, P4, and P5 showed the highest homology with BMYV.
Intraspecific and interspecific phylogenetic analyses have suggested that the BWYV-USA genome may be the result of recombination events between a CABYV-Iike ancestor contributing open reading frame (ORF) 0, ORF 1, and ORF 2, and a beet Polerovirus progenitor providing the 3' ORFs, with a similar mechanism of speciation occurring for BMYV in Europe.
Results demonstrate that BWYV-USA is a distinct species in the Polerovirus genus, clarifying the nomenclature of this important group of viruses.
