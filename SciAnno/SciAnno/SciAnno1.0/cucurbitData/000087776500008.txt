DL-3-aminobutyric acid (BABA), a non-protein amino acid, was found to induce resistance in melons and cucumbers against downy mildew caused by the fungus Pseudoperonospora cubensis.
BABA also protected melons against the wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.
sp.
melonis.
The 2- and 3-aminobutyric acid isomers were not effective.
BABA reduced disease intensity in different application forms (foliar spray, soil drench, leaf discs) while not showing fugicidal activity in vitro.
