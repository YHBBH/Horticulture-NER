Leaf samples from Thailand of Sauropus androgynus (L.) Merr.
plants presenting leaf yellowing symptoms were screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the presence of polerovirus infection.
In five of eight samples, a polerovirus was detected, and in four of these five polerovirus-positive samples, a begomovirus infection had been detected in a previous study.
The complete polerovirus genome sequence was determined from the sample which was not also infected with a begomovirus.
Analysis of the sequence revealed the typical genome organization of a polerovirus.
The highest nucleotide sequence identity to any other polerovirus species sequence in GenBank was 49% to pepper yellow leaf curl virus (PYLCV), and the highest amino acid sequence identity of all deduced protein sequences was 70% with the coat protein of PYLCV.
Based on these findings, we propose this novel polerovirus species be named Sauropus yellowing virus (SaYV).
