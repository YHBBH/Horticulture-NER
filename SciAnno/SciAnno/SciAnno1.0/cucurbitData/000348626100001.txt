Root-knot nematode-resistant rootstock lines (designated RKVL for Root-Knot Vegetable Laboratory) derived from wild watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var.
citroides) were compared with wild tinda (Praecitrullus fistulosus) lines and commercial cucurbit rootstock cultivars for grafting of seedless triploid watermelon `Tri-X 313' (C.
lanatus var.
lanatus) in a field infested with the southern root-knot nematode (RICN) (Meloidogyne incognita) in Charleston, SC, during 2009 and 2010.
In both years, RICN infection was severe in 'Emphasis' bottle gourd, 'Strong Tosa' hybrid squash, and wild tinda rootstocks with galling of the root system ranging from 86% to 100%.
In 2009, the RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks exhibited lower (P < 0.05) percentages of root galling (range 9% to 16%) than non-grafted `Tri-X 313' (41%), 'Emphasis', 'Strong Tosa', and the wild tinda rootstocks.
The grafted wild watermelon rootstock RKVL 318 produced more (PS 0.05) fruit (12 per plot) than all other entries (mean = five per plot), and it produced a heavier (PS 0.05) fruit yield (29.5 kg per plot) than all entries except self-grafted `Tri-X 313' (21.5 kg per plot).
In 2010, soil in half of the plots was treated with methyl bromide (50%):chloropicrin (50%) (392 kg.ha(-1)) before planting.
The RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks exhibited resistance to RKN with percentages of root system galled ranging from 11% for RKVL 316 to 56% for RKVL 301 in the untreated control plots.
Fruit yields in the untreated plots were 21.9, 25.6, and 19.9 kg/plot for RICVL 301, RKVL 316, and RICVL 318, respectively.
Yields were greater (P <= 0.05) for the three RICVL rootstocks than for 'Strong Tosa' (3:0 kg) and `Ojakkyo' wild watermelon rootstock (2.8 kg) in the untreated plots.
Yields of watermelon grafted on 'Strong Tosa' were nearly seven times greater (P <= 0.05) in the methyl bromide-treated plots than in the untreated plots.
In contrast, yields of RICVL 316 and RKVL 318 were similar in both treatments and the yield of RICVL 301 was less (P <= 0.05) in the methyl bromide-treated plots than in the untreated plots.
The three RKVL wild watermelon rootstock lines exhibited resistance to RKN.
RKVL 316 had low root galling and produced the heaviest fruit yield and greatest numbers of fruit of any rootstock evaluated in 2010.
The RKVL lines should be useful sources of RKN resistance for rootstocks for grafted watermelon.
