 Examination of mycelial and conidial features of 436 samples of cucurbit powdery mildews in Crete during 1991-92 revealed the presence of three species: Erysiphe sp., Sphaerotheca fusca and Leveillula taurica.
S.
fusca predominated both in the field and in the greenhouse.
Characteristics of the three pathogens are compared.
