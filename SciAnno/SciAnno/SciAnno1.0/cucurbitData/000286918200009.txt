Begomoviruses in cucurbits have emerged as a serious constraint in India over last three decades.
Several begomoviruses and their variants have been reported to affect cucurbits from various countries belonging to Africa, America and Asia of which 13 are well characterised and recognized as species.
Although, a great diversity of cucurbit infecting begomoviruses have been recorded in Asia, only two begomovirus species, Squash leaf curl China virus (synonyms, Pumpkin yellow vein mosaic virus) and Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) are known to affect cucurbits in India.
Yellow vein mosaic of pumpkin, the first cucurbit begomovirus diseases was recorded in India during 1950s.
Begomovirus disease problems in cucurbits emerged in India during 1980s onward.
ToLCNDV has emerged as the most important begomovirus causing leaf curl, yellow mosaic/mottle and stunting diseases in numerous cucurbits in northern India.
