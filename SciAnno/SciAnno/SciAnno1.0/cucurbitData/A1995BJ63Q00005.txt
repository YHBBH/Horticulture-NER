AB An unusual disease of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in India with symptoms of leaf crinkling, mottling, yellowing, and necrotic streaks on vines, shortened internodes, upright branches, and necrosis and dieback of the buds was shown to be caused by the watermelon strain of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV-W).
The virus was identified by host range, transmission by thrips, virus particle morphology, and serology.
The systemic infection of cucurbits and transmission by the vector Thrips flavus distinguished this isolate from most other tospoviruses.
Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with polyclonal antibodies indicated that TSWV-W is serologically related to the TSWV-W isolate from Taiwan, but not to tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) or impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV).
Although the watermelon isolate is serologically related to the groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV) from India, it differs in host range.
This is the first report of tospovirus naturally infecting watermelon in India.
