Fatty alcohol treatments can be used to eliminate the meristem of cucurbit (Cucurbitaceae) rootstocks, which prevents regrowth when grafting, but the effects of the treatment on the rootstock have not been documented.
Two rootstock types, 'Emphasis' bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and 'Carnivor' interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x C.
moschata) commonly used in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) grafting significantly increased in cotyledon and hypocotyl size over 21 days after treatment (DAT) with a 6.25% fatty alcohol emulsion.
There was a significant increase in total soluble sugar (glucose, sucrose, and fructose) content for each rootstock hypocotyl and cotyledon.
Starch concentrations of hypocotyls and cotyledons also increased significantly in both rootstocks.
This increase in stored energy could greatly increase the success rate of the grafting process.
Increased rootstock energy reserves could overcome the need for keeping the rootstock cotyledon intact when grafting.
