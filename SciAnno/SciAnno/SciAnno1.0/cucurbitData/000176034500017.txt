Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb) Matsum.
& Nakai.] seedlings may be repeatedly exposed to temperatures alternating between almost freezing and optimum soon after field transplanting.
'Carnival', 'Crimson Sweet', 'Millionaire' and 'Crimson Trio' watermelon transplants were exposed to cold temperature stress at 2+/-1 degreesC in a walk-in cooler and then to 29+/-5degreesC in a greenhouse immediately before field planting to simulate temperature alternations that may occur after field transplanting.
Cold-stressed transplants were field planted after all risk of ambient cold stress passed.
In 1998, transplants were exposed to 2degreesC from 9 hours to 54 hours, and in 1999 from 9 to 81 hours.
Early yields of all cultivars, except Carnival, significantly decreased with increasing hours of cold stress in both years.
Total yields of 'Carnival' decreased linearly in both years with a 10% yield reduction occurring from 14 to 15 hours of cold stress.
'Crimson Sweet' yields were reduced in 1999 only, with 16 hours of cold stress reducing yield 10%.
