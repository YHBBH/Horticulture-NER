BACKGROUNDThe squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), is a major insect pest of cucurbits.
Control of squash bugs with insecticidal chemicals is difficult to achieve.
We investigated the potential of companion planting with white yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) or feverfew [Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Sch.
Bip.] for squash bug management in field plantings of summer squash (Cucurbita pepo L.).
   RESULTSCompanion planting with white yarrow had few effects.
Companion planting with feverfew tended to reduce squash bug populations, but results often were not statistically significant (P 0.05).
Early-season ventilated row covers (without herbs) neither reduced squash bug populations nor increased squash yields.
Herbs reduced marketable squash yields compared with the control only once out of seven experiments.
   CONCLUSIONThe tested companion planting strategies inconsistently affected squash bug populations on summer squash.
Therefore, these strategies are not recommended to commercial producers.
