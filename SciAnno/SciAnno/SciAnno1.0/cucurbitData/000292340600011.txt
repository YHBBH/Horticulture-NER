Powdery mildews, caused by Golovinomyces cichoracearum and Podosphaera xanthii, are the most common and severe diseases of cucurbits in the Mediterranean basin.
In southern Italy, only P.
xanthii is apparently present.
However, information on its distribution and population biology is scanty, although it would be crucial for a more rational disease control.
Studies addressing physiological races, mating types and RAPD analysis were carried out on 82 isolates of P.
xanthii sampled in 34 cucurbit fields from Apulia (southern Italy).
A set of eight differential melon genotypes were used to discriminate physiological races of the fungus.
In particular, 13% of the tested isolates belonged to physiological race 2 FR, 30% to race 5, 25% to race 1, 10% to race 3, 5% to race 4, 1% to race 0 and 16% to undetermined races, whereas only one of the two mating types (MAT1-2) of the fungus was detected, and RAPD analysis showed a quite broad variation within fungal isolates.
