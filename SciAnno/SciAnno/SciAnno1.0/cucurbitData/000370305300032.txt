Over a dozen fungicides are registered in the United States to manage cucurbit downy mildew caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis.
Efficacy varies greatly among them, due, in part, to reduced sensitivity to some fungicides in some pathogen populations.
The objective of this study was to determine whether fungicide efficacy could be assessed using fungicide-treated cucumber (Cucumis sativus) exposed to natural inoculum for a brief period.
Potted cucumber plants were treated with water or 1 of 13 fungicides registered to control cucurbit downy mildew.
One day later, they were placed in a field among cucumber plants that had symptoms and signs of downy mildew.
After a 48-h exposure to P.
cubensis, potted plants were moved to a growth chamber held at day and night temperatures of 21 and 18 degrees C, respectively, and 50% relative humidity.
Severity (leaf area with symptoms) of downy mildew was rated 5 and 7 days later.
The assay was done eight times, twice each in July and October 2013 and 2014.
Year, season, trial, and interactions among these factors affected downy mildew development.
Severity at 7 days on plants treated with mandipropamid, azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, cymoxanil, fluopicolide, and propamocarb was not significantly different from the water control treatment in eight, five, three, three, two, and two of eight bioassays, respectively.
Severity on plants treated with cyazofamid, fluazinam, mancozeb + zoxamide, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and ametoctradin + dimethomorph was less than on plants treated with water in all bioassays.
These six fungicides should be effective when applied early in the season to prevent initial infections.
Cyazofamid and mancozeb + zoxamide prevented an increase in severity between rating times.
In conclusion, the assay consistently detected resistance to mandipropamid and azoxystrobin and demonstrated the efficacy of six other fungicides.
