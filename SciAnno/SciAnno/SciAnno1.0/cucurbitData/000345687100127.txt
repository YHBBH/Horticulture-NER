Virus diseases are very destructive especially on squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), which is grown for seeds in Konya province, therefore this research was conducted in order to determine the virus infections in major cucurbit growing areas in Konya province.
In total, 423 plant samples with common symptoms of virus infections like mosaic, inward curling, blistering, mottling, distortion, shoestring, stunting and vine decline were collected from squash, zucchini, melon, watermelon, snake melon, cucumber and pumpkin plants during 2009 and 2010.
The viruses were identified by DAS-ELISA and the results showed that 86.5% of plant samples were infected with Zucchini yellow mosaic Potyvirus (ZYMV), Watermelon mosaic Potyvirus-2 (WMV-2), Cucumber mosaic Cucumovirus (CMV), Papaya ringspot Potyvirus-watermelon strain (PRSV-W) or Squash mosaic Comovirus (SqMV).
ZYMV was predominant (55.1%) in the research area and occurred in squash, pumpkin, watermelon, snake melon, melon and cucumber plants.
WMV-2 was detected in snake melon at the ratio of 75% and it was followed by pumpkin (51.5%), watermelon (46.7%), squash (45.4%), melon (39.1%) and cucumber (20%).
Also mixed infections were common in squash, melon and pumpkin.
Cucumber green mottle mosaic Tobamovirus (CGMMV) was not present in the research area.
