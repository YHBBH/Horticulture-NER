To identify new bacterial antagonists for cucurbit downy mildew (CDM) caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis, 163 bacterial isolates were recovered from different microenvironments of field-grown cucumber plants.
In the greenhouse, 19 representative isolates were applied to cucumber plants as a foliar spray (FS); 7 isolates achieved the efficacy over 60% against CDM, with 5 (DS22, HS 10, DPI4, HP4, and DS57) identified as Bacillus pumilus, B.
licheniformis, Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, respectively.
Strains DPI4, DS22, and HS10 were assessed for their biocontrol effect on naturally occurring CDM in 2-year field trials (2010 and 2011), in which their overall efficacy relative to that of propamocarb was 106.25 to 117.17% with foliar spray plus root drench (FS+RD) but only 70.98 to 84.03% with FS.
Coincidently, DP14 and HS10 applied as root drench (RD) alone also significantly reduced CDM.
Under field conditions, DP14, DS22, and HSIO all successfully colonized cucumber leaves and the rhizosphere, and also significantly increased fruit yield by 37.60 to 51.03%, as well as nutrient levels.
Taken together, Enterobacter sp.
DP14, B.
licheniformis HSI, and B.
pumilus DS22 are plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria effective in controlling CDM in the field, whose efficacy increased with FS+RD compared with FS alone.
