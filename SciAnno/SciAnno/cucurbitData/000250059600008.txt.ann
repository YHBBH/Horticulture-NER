[@Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$ZLCV#Virus*]) is a [$tospovirus#Virus*] that infects species of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Brazil and is transmitted by the thrips Frankliniella [$zucchini#Plant*].
The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the reaction of seven species of [$cucurbits#Plant*] to infection with [$ZLCV#Virus*] under field and greenhouse conditions in Piracicaba County, SP.
In the field experiment, [$ZLCV#Virus*] infection occurred naturally.
In the greenhouse, plants were mechanically inoculated with [$ZLCV#Virus*] at the cotyledonal stage.
Evaluations were based on symptoms expression and detection of the virus by [$PTA-ELISA#Method*].
The percentages of infected plants for [$field and greenhouse assays#Method*], respectively, are indicated in parenthesis for each species/cultivar:[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] pepo var.
Caserta (72.9 and 70.7); [$C.maxima var.Alice#Plant*] (16.0 and 10.4); [$C.maxima var.Exposicao#Plant*] (0.0 and 0.0); [$C.moschata var.Menina Brasileira#Plant*] (29.2 and 18.2); [@C.maxima x C.moschata hybrid Takaiama#Plant*] (63.4 and 42.7); [@Citrullus lanatus var.Crimson Sweet#Plant*] (25.0 and 25.0); [@Cucumis sativus var.Safira#Plant*] (14.3 and 41.2); and [@C anguria#Plant*] (21.4 and 22.7).
