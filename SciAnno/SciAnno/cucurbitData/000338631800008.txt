Didymella bryoniae is an important pathogen of cucurbits worldwide.
Virulence factors of D.
bryoniae were investigated in regard to fungal growth and the production of the cell wall-degrading enzymes, polygalacturonase (PG), pectate lyase (PL), pectin lyase (PNL), beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) and cellulase (Cx).
Virulence levels of five D.
bryoniae isolates were determined by the severity of inoculated cantaloupe fruit decay.
The highly virulent isolates had more mycelial growth than the moderately virulent isolates in different media.
PG activities produced by the highly virulent isolates in shake cultures and in decayed fruit were greater than those of the moderately virulent isolates.
PNL, but not PL, in decayed fruit was higher with the highly virulent isolates compared to the moderately virulent ones.
The highly virulent isolates showed higher Cx activity than the moderately virulent ones in decayed fruit and in fruit tissue shake culture.
beta-Gal activities of the highly virulent isolates in pectin shake culture and in decayed fruit were greater than those of the two moderately virulent isolates although fruit also produced beta-Gal.
Protein analysis showed two fungal beta-Gal isozymes in decayed fruit compared to those of healthy fruit.
Correlation analysis indicated that the activities of PG, PNL, beta-Gal and Cx in cultures and in decayed fruit positively correlated with fungal growth and fruit decay severity.
The results of this study suggest that PG, PNL, beta-Gal, and Cx appear to be virulence factors of D.
bryoniae in cantaloupe decay with PG and beta-Gal as the most predominant fruit decay enzymes.
