 A variety of crops belonging to [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] are cultivated in South Africa.
They are attacked and damaged by a number of insects, [$spider mite#Virus*]s and [$nematodes#Virus*].
Larvae of [@pumpkin flies#Virus*], [@Didacus ciliatus#Virus*], [$D.vertebratus #Virus*]and other species, develop in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
In late season plantings, many or all fruits can be infested.
Alatae of [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*], [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] and other [$aphid species#Virus*] transmit [$watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]).
In summer when many [$cucurbit #Plant*]fields have been planted, 80-100 % of plants become infected by [$WMV#Virus*] and no [$crop#Plant*] is produced.
Larvae of [$pumpkin#Plant*] stem borer, Apomecyna binubila, develop in stems and laterals of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] and cause [$crop#Plant*] failure, but attacks are infrequent.
[$Spider mite#Virus*]s, [@Tetranychus urticae#Virus*] or [@T.ludeni#Virus*] damage the foliage of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in fields, and [$spider mite#Virus*]s and [$whitefly#Virus*], [$Trialeurodes vaporariorum#Virus*] damage the leaves of [$cucumbers#Plant*] in glasshouses or tunnels covered with plastic sheets.
[$Root-knot nematodes#Disease*], [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*] and [$M.javanica#Virus*] develop in roots and weaken them when [$cucurbits#Plant*] are grown on light soils.
