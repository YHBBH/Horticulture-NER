Background and Aims [$Watermelon#Plant*]s, [$Citrullus species#Plant*] ([$Cucurbitaceae#Virus*]), are native to Africa and have been cultivated since ancient times.
The fruit flesh of wild [$watermelons#Plant*] is watery, but typically hard-textured, pale-coloured and bland or bitter.
The familiar [@sweet dessert watermelons#Plant*], [$C.lanatus#Plant*], featuring non-bitter, tender, well-coloured flesh, have a narrow genetic base, suggesting that they originated from a series of selection events in a single ancestral population.
The objective of the present investigation was to determine where dessert [$watermelons#Plant*] originated and the time frame during which [$sweet dessert watermelons#Plant*] emerged.
   Key Findings Archaeological remains of [$watermelons#Plant*], mostly seeds, that date from 5000 years ago have been found in northeastern Africa.
An image of a large, striped, oblong fruit on a tray has been found in an Egyptian tomb that dates to at least 4000 years ago.
The Greek word pepon, Latin pepo and Hebrew avattiah of the first centuries ce were used for the same large, thick-rinded, wet fruit which, evidently, was the [$watermelon#Plant*].
Hebrew literature from the end of the second century ce and Latin literature from the beginning of the sixth century ce present [$watermelons#Plant*] together with three [$sweet#Plant*] fruits:[@ figs#Plant*], [$table grapes#Plant*] and [$pomegranates#Plant*].
Wild and primitive [$watermelons#Plant*] have been observed re[$pea#Plant*]tedly in Sudan and neighbouring countries of northeastern Africa.
   Conclusions The diverse evidence, combined, indicates that northeastern Africa is the centre of origin of the dessert [$watermelon#Plant*], that [$watermelons#Plant*] were domesticated for water and food there over 4000 years ago, and that [$sweet dessert watermelons#Plant*] emerged in Mediterranean lands by approximately 2000 years ago.
Next-generation ancient-DNA sequencing and state-of-the-art genomic analysis offer opportunities to rigorously assess the relationships among ancient and living wild and primitive [$watermelons#Plant*] from northeastern Africa, modern [$sweet dessert watermelons#Plant*] and other [@Citrullus taxa#Plant*].
