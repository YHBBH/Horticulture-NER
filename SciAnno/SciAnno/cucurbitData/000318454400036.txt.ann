[@Root-knot nematode#Disease*], [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*], remains to be one of the most important constraints in agricultural production worldwide.
However, reports showed that [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] population could be suppressed by the addition of organic amendments.
One of the methods for the control of [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] is the use of organic amendments, which have nematicidal effect.
The present investigation was carried out to evaluate organic amendments for the management of [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] ([$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*]) infesting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in field condition during 2009-10 and 2010-11.
Various organic amendments viz., [$neem cake#Plant*], [@castor cake#Plant*] and [@Jatropa cake#Plant*] were applied to the severely infested field 15 days before sowing @ 30 g/plant in randomized complete block design to the root zone of [$bitter gourd#Plant*], [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
Observations on initial and final nematode population along with number of galls per plant were recorded.
The results indicated that in [$bitter gourd#Plant*], [$neem cake#Plant*] performed well which recorded least number of galls (21.12 g/plant) and minimum nematode population (262.2 N/200 cc soil) compared to untreated control.
Whereas in untreated check, the number of galls was 129.6 g/plant with the population of 527.5 N/200 cc soil.
In [$bottle gourd#Plant*], [$neem cake#Plant*] reduced number of galls (54.61 g/plant) and also reduced nematode population (350 N/200 cc) compared to untreated control with higher yield (18.03 t/ha).
Untreated control recorded highest nematode galls i.
e.
155.7 g/plant with highest population (1272 N/200 cc).
Neem cake treated fields showed higher B : C (1 : 2.48).
In [$cucumber#Plant*], [$neem cake#Plant*] treated fields recorded least number of galls (61.66 g/plant), minimum nematode population (239.5 N/200 cc) with higher yield (11 t/ha), followed by jatropha and [$castor cake#Plant*]s, respectively.
Untreated check recorded highest galls (213.1 g/plant) with highest nematode population (541 N/200 cc) with lowest yield i.
e.
9.21 t/ha.
In total, on [$bitter gourd#Plant*], [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] for the period of 2009-10 and 2010-11, the soil application of [$neem cake#Plant*] @ 30 g/plant reduced root knot nematode incidence and also increased yield.
