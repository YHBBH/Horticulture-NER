[@Beet western yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BWYV#Virus*]; [$genus Polerovirus#Virus*], [$family Luteoviridae#Virus*]) is one of the most important viruses causing [$yellowing disease #Disease*]of many field and [$vegetable crops#Plant*].
This study isolated different [$poleroviruses#Virus*] from [$sugar beet#Plant*], [$spinach#Plant*], [$radish#Plant*] and [$brassica#Plant*] in Japan, and identified them as [$BWYV-JP#Virus*], [$Beet leaf yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$BLYV#Virus*]), [$Brassica yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BrYV#Virus*]) and [@BrYV-R#Virus*] ([$radish#Plant*] strain) based on host range and [$molecular analysis#Method*].
Among over 100 plant species from 19 families inoculated with the vector [$Myzus persicae#Virus*], about half of the species in 13 families were infected with some of these viruses.
[$BLYV#Virus*] shared a similar host range to [$Beet mild yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$BMYV#Virus*]).
These had a much more limited host range than [$BWYV-JP#Virus*], which resembled [$BWYV-USA#Virus*].
The host range of [$BrYV#Virus*] was similar to that of [$Turnip yellows virus#Virus*] ([$TuYV#Virus*]).
[$Phylogenetic analyses#Method*] at the 5 ' portion (replication-related[$ gene#Method*]) of the genome showed that [$BLYV#Virus*], [$BMYV#Virus*], [$BWYV#Virus*] (-JP and -USA) and [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) formed one large group, whereas [$BrYV#Virus*] and [$TuYV#Virus*] were grouped together.
[$BLYV#Virus*] and [$BWYV#Virus*] were most closely related to each other, and were more closely related to [$CABYV#Virus*] than to [$BMYV#Virus*].
However, at the 3 ' end ([$coat protein gene#Gene*]), [$BLYV#Virus*] and [$BWYV-JP#Virus*] formed a distinct group, separated from the [$BrYV#Virus*] group, which in turn was more closely related to [$BWYV-USA#Virus*], [$BMYV#Virus*], [$TuYV#Virus*] and [$Beet chlorosis virus#Virus*], a group originating from outside Asia.
Thus, this study presents host range differences and phylogeographical relationships of [$BWYV#Virus*]-like [$poleroviruses#Virus*] that are distributed worldwide.
