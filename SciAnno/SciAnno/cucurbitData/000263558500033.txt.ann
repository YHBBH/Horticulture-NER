[@Cucurbits#Plant*] belong to [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], includes about 118 genera and 825 species.
In India, a number of major and minor [$Cucurbits#Plant*] are cultivated, which share about 5.6% of the total [$vegetable#Plant*] production.
They are consumed in various forms i.e., [@salad#Plant*] ([$cucumber#Plant*], [@gherkins#Plant*], [@long melon#Plant*]), [@sweet#Plant*] ([$ash gourd#Plant*], [@pointed gourd#Plant*]), [@pickles#Plant*] ([$gherkins#Plant*]), and [@deserts (melons)#Plant*].
In India, several research institutes and universities have utilized a number of cultivated and wild species to develop improved varieties and parental lines.
About 112 open pollinated varieties of several [$cucurbits#Plant*] have been recommended for cultivation at national and state levels.
Among these, 48 improved varieties in 8 major [$cucurbits#Plant*] have been identified and recommended through All India Coordinated Vegetable Improvement Project.
Similarly, 26 hybrids and 7 disease resistant varieties of major [$cucurbits#Plant*] have also been developed.
The main goal of research on [$cucurbitaceous vegetables#Plant*] in India is to improve productivity on Sustainable basis through developing biotic and abiotic resistant variety/hybrids coupled with quality attributes.
The yield potential of [$cucurbits#Plant*] could be increased by adopting the standardized agro-techniques and plant protection measures.
