 Application of pyrethroid insecticides to field-grown [$cantaloupes#Plant*] had a significant impact on the number of fruit produced per plant but did not influence the rate at which [$cantaloupes#Plant*] were infected with aphid-transmitted [$zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
Plots that received permethrin had significantly more fruit per plant than control plots, whereas treatment with fenvalerate did not affect yield.
In a greenhouse experiment, noninfected [$cantaloupe#Plant*] plants and plants infected with [$ZYMV#Virus*] during early vegetative growth, perfect flower production, and fruit set were treated with the same pyrethroid insecticides.
Plant response to these treatments was measured as number of perfect flowers, plant weight, fruit weight, and number of fruit.
Plants treated with permethrin produced a higher average fruit weight than plants that were not treated.
All growth parameters were significantly lower among control plants infected with [$ZYMV#Virus*] during the vegetative stage; however, the first three were significantly increased by treatment with fenvalerate at that growth stage.
These experiments suggest that pyrethroids have a stimulatory effect on plants infected with virus, which is manifested in increased plant growth and yield.
