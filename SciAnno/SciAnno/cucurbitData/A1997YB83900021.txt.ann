[@Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) was isolated in 1993 from a [$squash plant#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita pepo cv.Eskandrani#Plant*]) showing severe leaf and fruit distortions, collected in the Gezira region (Sudan).
This isolate ([@ZYMV-Su#Virus*]) was found to be very closely serologically related if not identical to the type strain from Italy.
The host range was mostly limited to [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] but systemic infection was found to occur on [@sesame#Plant*] ([$Sesamum indicum#Plant*]), an important cultivated [$crop#Plant*] in Sudan.
[$ZYMV-Su#Virus*] induced mosaic symptoms on the resistant [$melon#Plant*] accession PI 414723, indicating that it belongs to pathotype 2, but did not cause [@wilting of melon cv.Dobulon#Disease*].
[$ZYMV-Su#Virus*] was efficiently transmitted by [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] and Aphis [$gossypii#Plant*] in a non-persistent manner.
Surveys conducted from 1993 to 1995 revealed that [$ZYMV#Virus*] occurred in the major [$cucurbit#Plant*] growing areas in Sudan, in a diversity of [$crops#Plant*] and agroecosystems.
