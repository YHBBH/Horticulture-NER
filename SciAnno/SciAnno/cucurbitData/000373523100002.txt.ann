[@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]) of [$cucurbits#Plant*] has been observed to survive for >34 years in stored [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds.
To better understand this remarkable longevity, we investigated the bacterium's tolerance to desiccation and the effect of bacterial localization in different [$watermelon#Plant*] seed tissues on its survival.
We compared the ability of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]to tolerate desiccation on filter [$paper#Plant*] discs and on host ([$watermelon#Plant*]) and nonhost ([$cabbage#Plant*], [$corn#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*]) seeds to two seedborne ([@Xanthomonas campestris pv.campestris#Virus*] and [@Pantoea stewartii subsp.stewartii#Virus*]) and one soilborne ([$Ralstonia solanacearum#Virus*]) plant-[$pathogen#Virus*]ic bacteria.
[$A.citrulli #Virus*]survival on dry filter paper (>12 weeks) was similar to that of [@X.campestris pv.campestris#Virus*] but longer than [@P.stewartii subsp.stewartii#Virus*].
[$Ralstonia solanacearum#Virus*] survived longer than all other bacteria tested.
On all seeds tested, [$A.citrulli #Virus*]and [@X.campestris pv.campestris#Virus*] populations [$decline#Disease*]d by 5 orders of magnitude after 12 weeks of incubation at 4 degrees C and 50% relative humidity, while [$R.solanacearum#Virus*] populations [$decline#Disease*]d by 3 orders.[@P.stewartii subsp#Virus*].
stewartii was not recovered after 12 weeks of incubation.
To determine the effect of tissue localization on bacterial survival, [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds [$infe#Plant*]sted with [$A.citrulli #Virus*]by flower stigma inoculation (resulting in bacterial localization in the embryo/endosperm) or by ovary pericarp inoculations (resulting in bacterial localization under the testa) were treated with peroxyacetic acid or chlorine (Cl-2) gas.
Following these treatments, a significantly higher reduction in [$BFB#Disease*] seed-to-seedling transmission was observed for seeds generated by ovary pericarp inoculation (>= 89.5%) than for those generated by stigma inoculation (<= 76.5%) (P < 0.05).
Additionally, higher populations of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]survived when the bacteria were localized to the embryo/endosperm versus the seed coat, suggesting that tissue localization is important for bacterial survival in seed.
This observation was confirmed when P stewartii subsp.stewartii survived significantly longer in stigma-inoculated (embryo/endosperm-localized) [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds than in vacuum-infiltrated (testa-localized) seeds.
Based on these results we conclude that [$A.citrulli #Virus*]cells are not intrinsically tolerant to desiccation and that localization of the bacterium to testa tissues does not enhance [$A.citrulli #Virus*]survival.
In contrast, it is likely that embryo/endosperm localization enhances the survival of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]and other bacteria in seeds.
