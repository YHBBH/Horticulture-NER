The [@downy mildew diseases#Disease*] are caused by different [@fungus species#Virus*] in several genera in the class Oomycetes.
They comprise a major group of diseases affecting a large number of [$crops#Plant*].
In India, [@downy mildews#Disease*] have been reported on several economically important [$crops#Plant*], including [@maize#Plant*], [$sorghum#Plant*], [@pearl millet#Plant*], [@onion#Plant*], [$soybean#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], and [$grapes#Plant*], causing severe economic losses in some regions and seasons.
Pathogens reported to cause [@downy mildews#Disease*] in India include species in the genera, [@Perenosclerospora#Virus*], [@Perenospora#Virus*], [@Pseudoperonospora#Virus*], [@Plasmopara#Virus*], [@Sclerophthora#Virus*] and [@Sclerospora#Virus*].
In view of the economic importance of the [$crops#Plant*], and prevalence and severity of the disease, the [$downy mildews#Virus*] have been classified into high, moderate and low research priority problems.
In this article we present a brief review of the work done in India related to [@pathogen biology, epidemiology and management methods#Method*], and provide an outlook for future research.
