We investigate the effect of post-conditioning periods and seed orientation on the vigor of cucurbit seeds with [@dry heat treatment (DHT)#Method*].
All the [@dry-heat treated seeds#Method*] exhibited varying degree of seed vigor decreases.
In general, [$pumpkin#Plant*] seeds showed less vigor decreases than the [$bottle gourd#Plant*] seeds.
When the [@dry heat treated seeds#Method*] were germinated after post-conditioning for 0, 30, and 120 days, the percentage of germination was enhanced by increasing the period of post-conditioning and the efficiency of post-conditioning differed by [$crop#Plant*] and cultivar.
In both [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*], the vigor of seeds placed in vertically upward and horizontal orientations was higher than that of the seeds placed in the vertically downward orientation.
The results suggested that the vigor of [$dry-heat treated seeds#Method*] could be improved by applying the proper post-conditioning and seed orientation.
