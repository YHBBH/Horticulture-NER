[@Zucchini yellow fleck virus#Virus*] ([$ZYFV#Virus*]) is a polyvirus that occurs in [$cucurbits#Plant*] grown in some Mediterranean countries, 'Marketer' [$cucumber#Plant*] responded to [$ZYFV#Virus*] infection with a severe mosaic, stunting, and leaf and fruit deformation.
A high level of resistance to this virus was found in a single plant selection of 'Taichung Mon Gua' (TMG) [$cucumber#Plant*] from Taiwan.
In F-2 and backcross populations involving TMG x 'Marketer', the resistance to [$ZYFV#Virus*] was determined to be conferred by a single recessive gene, to which the symbol zyf is assigned.
