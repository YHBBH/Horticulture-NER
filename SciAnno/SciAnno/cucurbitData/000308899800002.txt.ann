An evaluation of [@cucurbits#Plant*] for susceptibility to [$cucurbitaceous#Plant*] and [$solanaceous #Plant*][$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] isolates.
Plant Dis.
96:1404-1414.
   [$Cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]) production in Michigan is limited by the oomycete [$pathogen#Virus*] [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*].
[$Cucumber#Plant*],[$ summer squash#Plant*], and [$winter squash#Plant*] fruit were evaluated for susceptibility to five isolates of [@P.capsici#Virus*].
Detached fruit were inoculated with a 5-mm-diameter culture plug of mycelia and sporangia and were incubated in a laboratory or greenhouse.
Lesion and [$pathogen#Virus*] growth diameters were measured and [$pathogen#Virus*] growth density was visually assessed.
All [$P capsici#Virus*] isolates incited rot, with significant differences found among fruit type and [$pathogen#Virus*] isolate.
Straightneck [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), [@slicing cucumber#Plant*], and [$butternut squash#Plant*] ([@C.moschata#Plant*]) exhibited more severe symptoms than the other fruit tested.
Summer and [$winter squash#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] were evaluated in [$greenhouse experiments#Method*], in which [$P capsici#Virus*]-infested [$millet#Plant*] seed (approximately I g) were placed on the surface of soilless potting media.
Disease severity was visually assessed every 2 days for 14 days post inoculation.
Crop type, [$pathogen#Virus*] isolate, or the [$crop#Plant*] type [$pathogen#Virus*] isolate interaction term were significant for symptom appearance and area under the disease progress curve values.
Differences in susceptibility of [$butternut squash#Plant*] and [$zucchini#Plant*] cultivars were observed following inoculation with [$solanaceous #Plant*]isolate 13351.
Results from this study can refine management programs for [$Phytophthora#Virus*] rot.
