This study was conducted to investigate pathogenic, morphologic, and genetic variations among [@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] isolates from processing [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]) fields in Illinois.
[@Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers#Method*] were employed to assess genetic variation among 24 isolates of [@P.capsici#Virus*] from 10 individual fields at six locations.
[@Unweighted mean pair group analysis#Method*] clustered isolates into six groups.
The genetic distances ranged from 0.03 to 0.45.
Inoculation of [$pumpkin#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] in the greenhouse revealed that the isolates belonged to six distinct genetic groups differing significantly (P = 0.05) in virulence.
[@Isolates tested#Method*] exhibited four growth patterns in culture: cottony, rosaceous, petaloid, and stellate.[$P.capsici#Virus*] isolates.including an ATCC isolate (ATCC-15427), with cottony growth pattern did not grow at 36degreesC.
The mean oospore diameter of A I mating type isolates was greater than that of A2 mating type isolates.
Nine of 24 isolates tested produced chlamydospores in V8-CaCO3 liquid medium.
