 Thirty-nine isolates of [$Fusarium oxysporum#Virus*] encompassing five formae speciales causing [$vascular wilt#Disease*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*] were examined for genetic similarity by [@restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis#Method*] of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
Total DNA was digested with three enzymes (PstI, HindIII, and EcoRI), Southern blotted, and hybridized with a F.o.niveum mtDNA polyprobe (pFON2a-pFON8b).
The presence or absence of mtDNA fragments was examined by the unweighted-paired-group method using averages (UPGMA) and parsimony analysis.
A total of 14 mtDNA [@RFLP#Method*] groups were detected.
Within each forma specialis there were unique [@RFLPs#Method*]; however, one pattern generally occurred most frequently for each forma specialis.
Two [@RFLP#Method*] groups ([@RFLP#Method*]G-fspI and IX) occurred in four and two formae speciales, respectively.
The [@RFLP#Method*] haplotype most common in F.o.niveum ([@RFLP#Method*]G-fspI) also occurred in one or more isolates from every other formae speciales except [@F.o.luffae#Virus*] and was present in isolates from North America, Europe, and Asia.
Genetic distances[$ gene#Method*]rated by UPGMA suggest that F.o.niveum was the least diverse forma specialis, while F.o.cucumerinum was the most diverse.
However, both [$cluster analysis#Method*] and [@parsimony analysis#Method*] indicated that all of [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]formae speciales in the [$cucurbits#Plant*] are closely related and, in some cases, isolates of different formae speciales were genetically more similar than isolates of the same forma specialis.
