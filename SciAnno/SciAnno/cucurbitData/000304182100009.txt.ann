   [$Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]), a recently described [@Ipomovirus sp.#Virus*]
in the [$family Potyviridae#Virus*], is the cause of viral [$watermelon vine decline#Method*], a devastating disease in Florida.
[$SqVYV#Virus*] is known to be transmitted by the whitetly, [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] ([$Gennadius#Virus*]) B strain, but details of the transmission process have not previously been investigated.
We completed a series of experiments to determine efficiency of transmission, effects of different acquisition and inoculation access periods, the length of time that [$whiteflies#Virus*] retained transmissible virus, and the minimum time needed to complete a cycle of acquisition and inoculation.
Efficiency was low, with at least 30 whitetlies per plant needed for consistent transmission.
Acquisition leading to later transmission peaked at 4 h, and inoculation access periods longer than 4 to 8 h led to no increase in infection rates.
Whiteflies retained virus only a short time, with no transmission by 24 h after removal from infected plants.
A minimum of 3 h was needed to complete a cycle of transmission under laboratory conditions.
These results demonstrate semipersistent transmission of [$SqVYV#Virus*] and will help refine models of the epidemiology of this virus and the disease it causes.
