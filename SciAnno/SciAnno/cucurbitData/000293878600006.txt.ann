[@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] causes [@seedling blight and bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits#Disease*].
Previous reports demonstrated the contribution of type IV pili (T4P) to [$A.citrulli #Virus*]virulence and to systemic infection of [$melon seedlings#Plant*].
[@Microfluidic flow-chamber assays#Method*] demonstrated the involvement of TAP in surface adhesion and biofilm formation, whereas polar flagella did not appear to contribute to either of these features.
On the other hand, a transposon mutant impaired in the biosynthesis of polar flagella was identified in screens for reduced virulence of an [$A.citrulli #Virus*]mutant library.
Further characterization of polar flagellum mutants confirmed that [$A.citrulli #Virus*]requires a polar flagellum for full virulence on [$melon plants#Plant*].
[@Foliage and stem inoculation experiments#Method*] revealed that polar flagella contribute to [$A.citrulli #Virus*]virulence and growth in planta at both pre- and post-host-tissue penetration.
Interestingly, light microscope observations revealed that almost all [$A.citrulli #Virus*]wild-type cells extracted from the xylem sap of stem-inoculated [$melon seedlings#Plant*] remained motile, supporting the importance of this organelle in virulence and colonization of the host vascular system.
We also report a negative effect of polar flagellum impairment on T4P-mediated twitching motility of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]and discuss a possible co-regulation of these two motility machineries in this bacterium.
