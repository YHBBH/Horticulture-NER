A [@potyvirus#Virus*] (Su-94-54) was isolated from a naturally infected [$snake cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*] var.
flexuosus) plant with severe mosaic and leaf deformation symptoms collected in Eastern Sudan.
This isolate has a host range limited to [$cucurbits#Plant*] and is serologically distantly related to [$Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MWMV#Virus*]) and to [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]).
[$Coat protein sequence analysis#Method*] of Su-94-54 and [$MWMV#Virus*] and comparison with other [$potyvirus#Virus*]es indicate that Su-94-54 is more closely related to [$MWMV#Virus*] than to any other [$potyvirus#Virus*].
Based on the amino acid sequence identity in the core part of the [$coat protein#Gene*] with [$MWMV#Virus*] (86%), this isolate could be regarded as a distinct species.
However, because of biological, cytological, and serological affinities with [$MWMV#Virus*], we propose that this isolate be considered as a strain of [$MWMV#Virus*], possibly an evolutionary intermediate between [$MWMV#Virus*] and [$PRSV#Virus*], until more is known on the structure of the [$PRSV#Virus*] subgroup within the genus [$Potyvirus#Virus*].
