The exploitation of synthetic polyploids for producing seedless fruits is well known in watermelon.
Tetraploid progenitors of triploid [$watermelon#Plant*] plants, compared with their diploid counterparts, exhibit wide phenotypic differences.
Although many factors modulate alternative splicing (AS) in plants, the effects of autopolyploidization on AS are still unknown.
In this study, we used tissues of leaf, stem, and fruit of diploid and tetraploid [$sweet#Plant*] [$watermelon#Plant*] to understand changes in gene expression and the occurrence of AS.
RNA-sequencing analysis was performed along with [@reverse transcription quantitative#Method*] [$PCR#Method*] and [@rapid amplification of cDNA ends#Method*] ([@RACE)-PCR#Method*] to demonstrate changes in expression and splicing.
All vegetative tissues except fruit showed an increased level of AS in the tetraploid [$watermelon#Plant*] throughout the growth period.
The ploidy levels of diploids and the tetraploid were confirmed using a ploidy analyser.
We identified 5362 and 1288 genes that were up- and downregulated, respectively, in tetraploid as compared with diploid plants.
We further confirmed that 22 genes underwent AS events across tissues, indicating possibilities of generating different protein isoforms with altered functions of important transcription factors and transporters.
Arginine biosynthesis, chlorophyllide synthesis, GDP mannose biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose degradation pathways were upregulated in autotetraploids.
[$Phloem protein 2#Gene*], chloroplastic PGR5-like protein, zinc-finger protein, fructokinase-like 2, MYB transcription factor, and nodulin MtN21 showed AS in fruit tissues.
These results should help in developing high-quality seedless [$watermelon#Plant*] and provide additional transcriptomic information related to other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
