The pattern of accumulation of [@Citcurbit Yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]; [@genus Crinivirus#Virus*], [@family Closteroviridae#Virus*]) RNA has been analyzed in several [$cucurbit#Plant*] accessions.
In susceptible accessions of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), [@marrow#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]), and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), [$CYSDV#Virus*] RNA accumulation peaked during the first to second week postinoculation in the first to third leaf above the inoculated one; younger leaves showed very low or undetectable levels of [$CYSDV#Virus*].
Three [$melon#Plant*] accessions previously shown to remain asymptomatic after [$CYSDV#Virus*] inoculation under natural conditions were also assayed for their susceptibility to [$CYSDV#Virus*].
[@Hybridization#Method*] and [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) analysis of noninoculated leaves showed that only one of these, C-105, remained virus-free for up to 6 weeks after [$whitefly#Virus*] inoculation.
In this accession, very low [$CYSDV#Virus*] levels were detected by [$RT-PCR#Method*] in [$whitefly#Virus*]-inoculated leaves, and therefore, multiplication or spread of [$CYSDV#Virus*] in C-105 plants ap[$pea#Plant*]red to remain restricted to the inoculated leaves.
When C-105 plants were graft inoculated, [$CYSDV#Virus*] RNA could be detected in phloem tissues, but the systemic colonization of C-105 by [$CYSDV#Virus*] upon graft inoculation seemed to be seriously impeded.
Additionally, in situ hybridization experiments showed that, after C-105 graft inoculation, only a portion of the vascular bundles in petioles and stems were colonized by [$CYSDV#Virus*] and virus could not be found in leaf veins.
[@RT-PCR experiments#Method*] using primers to specifically detect negative-sense [$CYSDV#Virus*] RNA were carried out and showed that [$CYSDV#Virus*] replication took place in graft-inoculated C-105 [$scions#Plant*].
Therefore, the resistance mechanism may involve a restriction of the virus movement in the vascular system of the plants and/or prevention of high levels of virus accumulation.
