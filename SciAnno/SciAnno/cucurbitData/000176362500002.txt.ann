The causal agent of [@gummy stem blight#Disease*], [@Didymella bryoniae#Virus*], often is isolated from infected [@cucurbits#Plant*] together with other [@Phoma spp#Virus*].
[@Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific#Method*] to [@D.bryoniae#Virus*] and [@Phoma#Virus*] were used to develop and evaluate a microtiter-based [$PCR#Method*]-[$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]) technique.
Primers were modified by addition of a fluorescein and a biotin label to the 5' ends of the forward and reverse primers, respectively.
After amplification, [$PCR#Method*] products were detected in an [$ELISA#Method*] using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antifluorescein antibody and three substrates that yielded three colored products, one for each fungal group.
The most sensitive substrate (highest signal:noise ratio) was 2,2'-azino-bis[3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid].
[$PCR#Method*]-[$ELISA#Method*] successfully detected 45 of 46 [@D.bryoniae#Virus*] and all 13 [$Phoma#Virus*] isolates that were used.
Results were comparable to those obtained with [@gel electrophoresis#Method*].
Only one [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] isolate could not be detected with [$PCR#Method*]-[$ELISA#Method*]; this isolate also produced a fragment larger than other [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] isolates on [@agarose gels#Method*].
[$PCR#Method*]-[$ELISA#Method*] was used successfully on crude extracts of "blind" fungal samples and identified seven of seven isolates as [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] or [$Phoma#Virus*].
Although less sensitive than [$gel electrophoresis#Method*], [$PCR#Method*]-[$ELISA#Method*] was a highly specific, yet simple, rapid and convenient assay for detection of [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] and [@Phoma#Virus*] sp.
