Background: There are few genomic tools available in [@melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]), a member of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], despite its importance as a [$crop#Plant*].
Among these tools, genetic maps have been constructed mainly using [@marker types such as simple sequence repeats (SSR)#Method*], [@restriction fragment length polymorphisms#Method*] ([@RFLP#Method*]) and [@amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) in different mapping populations.#Method*]
There is a growing need for saturating the genetic map with [@single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)#Method*], more amenable for high throughput analysis, especially if these markers are located in gene coding regions, to provide functional markers.
Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from [$melon#Plant*] are available in public databases, and resequencing ESTs or validating SNPs detected in silico are excellent ways to discover SNPs.
   Results: EST-based SNPs were discovered after resequencing ESTs between the parental lines of the PI 161375 (SC) x 'Piel de sapo' (PS) genetic map or using in silico SNP information from EST databases.
In total 200 EST-based SNPs were mapped in the [$melon#Plant*] genetic map using a bin-mapping strategy, increasing the map density to 2.35 cM/marker.
A subset of 45 SNPs was used to study variation in a panel of 48 [$melon#Plant*] accessions covering a wide range of the genetic diversity of the species.
[@SNP analysis#Method*] correctly reflected the genetic relationships compared with other marker systems, being able to distinguish all the accessions and cultivars.
   Conclusion: This is the first example of a genetic map in a [$cucurbit species#Plant*] that includes a major set of [$SNP markers#Method*] discovered using ESTs.
The PI 161375 x 'Piel de sapo' [$melon#Plant*] genetic map has around 700 markers, of which more than 500 are gene-based markers (SNP, [$RFLP#Gene*] and SSR).
This genetic map will be a central tool for the construction of the [$melon#Plant*] physical map, the step prior to sequencing the complete genome.
Using the set of [$SNP markers#Method*], it was possible to define the genetic relationships within a collection of forty-eight [$melon#Plant*] accessions as efficiently as with [$SSR markers#Method*], and these markers may also be useful for cultivar identification in Occidental [$melon#Plant*] varieties.
