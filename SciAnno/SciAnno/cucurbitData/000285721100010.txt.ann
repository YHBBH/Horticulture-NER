The responses of diverse [@cucurbit#Plant*] accessions, including [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], and [@Momordica spp.#Plant*], to [@Meloidogyne javanica#Plant*] and [@M.incognita#Plant*], were evaluated.
   For [$melons#Plant*] and [$cucumbers#Plant*], severity of galling was significantly affected by nematode species, but no significant effects of cultivars or cultivar x nematode species interactions on the level of galling were observed.
Severity of galling was always higher for [$M.incognita#Plant*] than for [@M.javanica#Plant*] in any cultivar tested.
Galling indices in [$melons#Plant*] were 0.3 and 1.6, and in [$cucumber#Plant*] 2.8 and 3.7, for [$M.javanica#Plant*] and [$M.incognita#Plant*], respectively.
[$Watermelon#Plant*] did not did show root galling when inoculated with [$M.javanica#Plant*] and showed a very low index (0-0.3) with [$M.incognita#Plant*].
[$Cucurbita#Virus*] acces[$sions#Plant*] evaluated were the most susceptible.
Galling index in [$pumpkin#Plant*] inoculated with [$M.javanica#Plant*] was significantly lower than that caused by [$M.incognita#Plant*].
[$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] and the intraspecific hybrids of [$C.moschata#Plant*] were more resistant than commercial cultivars of [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] used as susceptible controls.
Two [$Momordica charantia#Plant*] acces[$sions#Plant*] out of 12 tested exhibited no or very low root galling in response to [$M.incognita#Plant*] and [$M.javanica#Plant*].
These findings indicate high resistance but not immunity to the [$nematodes#Virus*].
