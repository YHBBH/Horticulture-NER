In this study, [@Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus#Virus*] ([@TYLCSV#Virus*]) and the strains Israel and Mild of [$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([@TYLCV-IL#Virus*], [@TYLCV-Mld#Virus*] were detected for the first time in four [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Jordan by nested [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] (OCR).
These viruses cause the [$tomato yellow leaf curl disease#Disease*] ([$TYLCD#Disease*]) in [$tomato#Plant*].
[$Cucumber#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] plants inoculated with [$TYLCV-IL#Virus*][JO:Cuc], [$TYLCV#Virus*]-Mld, [$TYLCSV#Virus*]-IT[IT:Sar:88] and the Jordanian isolate of [$TYLCV#Virus*] ([@TYLCV-JV#Plant*]) did not show disease symptoms.
However, virus-specific fragments were detected in uppermost leaves of symptomless plants by n[$PCR#Method*].
A [$whitefly#Virus*] transmission test showed that [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] could transmit [@TYLCV-Mld#Virus*] from [$cucumber#Plant*] into [$tomato#Plant*] and jimson[$weed#Plant*] plants.
However, all infected [$tomato#Plant*] plants remained symptomless.
In addition, results of semi-quantitative [$PCR#Method*] (sq[$PCR#Method*]) analysis showed that the relative amount of [$TYLCV-Mld#Virus*] DNA acquired by [$B.tabaci#Virus*] from [$Cucumber#Plant*] plants was less than that acquired from [$tomato#Plant*] plants.
