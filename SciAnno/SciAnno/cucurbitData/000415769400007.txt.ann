[@Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]) is a bipartite [$begomovirus#Virus*] that causes severe diseases to [$cucurbits#Plant*], particularly [$watermelon#Plant*], across Eastern Mediterranean countries.
[$Watermelon#Plant*] plants showing [$begomovirus#Virus*]-associated symptoms and virus vector [$whitefly#Virus*] infestation were collected from a cultivated area in Sonora, Mexico.
Using rolling circle amplification (RCA) and sequencing, the full-length genome of an isolate of [$WmCSV#Virus*] was obtained.
Agrobacterium-mediated virus inoculation to [$Solanaceae #Plant*]([$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*]) and [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] ([$Squash#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*]) plants, fulfilled Koch's postulates confirming the disease causal agent.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of [$WmCSV#Virus*] associated to [$cucurbit #Plant*]diseases in the Western Hemisphere.
