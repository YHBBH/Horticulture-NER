Mixed infections in cucurbits are frequently observed in natural conditions between viruses from the Potyvirus genus and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), which significantly decreases productivity.
The objectives of the present study was to compare the host range of PRSV-W, WMV, and ZYMV isolates and evaluate the effects of mixed infections with CMV in zucchini plants (Cucurbita pepo L.).
Host range studies comprising 23 plant species confirmed some similarities and biological differences among the isolates of PRSV-W, ZYMV, and WMV.
RT-PCR confirmed the amplification of DNA fragments of the PRSV-W, WMV, and ZYMV coat protein gene (cp) and cytoplasm inclusion gene (ci).
The virus interaction studies in zucchini Caserta plants indicated synergistic interactions, particularly among species from the Potyvirus genus, and some CMV interference with some virus combinations.
