[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) was identified in the fall of 2006 affecting [$cucurbit #Plant*]production in the southwestern United States (California, Arizona), as well as in nearby Sonora, Mexico, resulting in nearly universal infection of fall [$melon crops#Plant*] in 2006 and 2007, and late infection of 2007 spring [$melons#Plant*].
Survival of [$CYSDV#Virus*] through the largely [$cucurbit#Plant*]-free winter months suggested the presence of [$weed#Plant*] or alternate [$crop#Plant*] hosts, although previous studies indicated a limited host range restricted to members of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
To determine potential reservoir hosts for [$CYSDV#Virus*] in desert production, [$weed#Plant*] and [@crop hosts#Plant*] were collected from throughout the region over a period of 26 months, and were tested for the presence of [$CYSDV#Virus*] by [@reverse transcription-polymerise chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) [@using CYSDV HSP70h- and coat protein gene-specific primers#Method*].
Many non[$cucurbits#Plant*] collected from infected [$melon#Plant*] fields and nearby areas were symptomless and virus free; however, [$CYSDV#Virus*] was detected in [$alfalfa#Plant*] ([@Medicago sativa#Plant*]), [$lettuce#Plant*] ([$Lactuca sativa#Plant*]), and [@snap bean#Plant*] ([$Phaseolus vulgaris#Plant*]), as well as in several [$weed#Plant*] species widely prevalent in the region.
Typical crinivirus symptoms of interveinal yellowing and leaf brittleness were observed on [$CYSDV#Virus*]-infected [$snap bean#Plant*], [@alkali mallow#Plant*] ([@Silo hederacea#Plant*]) and [@Wright's groundcherry#Plant*] ([@Physalis wrightii#Plant*]), while other infected [$crop#Plant*] and [$weed hosts#Plant*] were symptom less.
Transmission tests demonstrated that [$lettuce#Plant*], [$snap bean#Plant*], [$alkali mallow#Plant*], [$Wright's groundcherry#Plant*], and [@buffalo gourd#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita foetidissima#Plant*]) could serve as virus reservoir hosts for transmission of [$CYSDV#Virus*] to [$melon#Plant*] and other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
These results expand the previously known host range of [$CYSDV#Virus*], demonstrating that the virus is capable of infecting not only members of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], but also plants in seven additional taxonomic families.
