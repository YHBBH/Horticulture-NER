A full-length drought-responsive gene [@Ccrboh#Gene*], encoding the respiratory burst oxidase homologue (rboh), was cloned in [$Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*], a very drought-tolerant [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
The robh protein, also named NADPH oxidase, is conserved in plants and animals, and functions in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
The [$Ccrboh#Gene*] gene accumulated in a tissue-specific pattern when [$C.colocynthis#Plant*] was treated with PEG, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), or NaCl, while the homologous rboh gene did not show any change in [$C.lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*], cultivated [$watermelon#Plant*], during drought.
Grafting experiments were conducted using [$C.colocynthis#Plant*] or [$C.lanatus#Plant*] as the rootstock or scion.
Results showed that the rootstock significantly affects gene expression in the scion, and some signals might be transported from the root to the shoot.
[$Ccrboh#Gene*] in [$C.colocynthis#Plant*] was found to function early during plant development, reaching high mRNA transcript levels 3 d after germination.
The subcellular location of [$Ccrboh#Gene*] was investigated by transient expression of the 35S::[$Ccrboh#Gene*]::GFP fusion construct in protoplasts.
The result confirmed that [$Ccrboh#Gene*] is a transmem[$bran#Plant*]e protein.
Our data suggest that [$Ccrboh#Gene*] might be functionally important during the acclimation of plants to stress and also in plant development.
It holds great promise for improving drought tolerance of other [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
