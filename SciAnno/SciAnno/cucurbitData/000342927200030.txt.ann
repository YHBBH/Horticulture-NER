The 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway provides the precursors for the biosynthesis of plastidial isoprenoids, which include the carotenoid pigments of many fruits.
We have analysed the genes encoding the seven enzymes of the MEP pathway in [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) and determined that the first one, [@1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS)#Gene*], and the last one, [@1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR)#Gene*], are represented in the genome as a small gene family and paralogous pair, respectively.
In the case of DXS, three genes encode functional DXS activities which fall into previously established type I ([@CmDXS1#Gene*]) and II ([@CmDXS2a #Gene*]and [@CmDXS2b#Gene*]) categories, while a fourth DXS-like gene belonging to the type III group did not encode a protein with DXS activity.
Their expression patterns and phylogenies suggest that [$CmDXS1#Gene*] is functionally specialized for developmental and photosynthetic processes, while [$CmDXS2a #Gene*]and [$CmDXS2b#Gene*] are induced in flowers and ripening fruit of orange- (but not white-) fleshed varieties, coinciding with beta-carotene accumulation.
This is the first instance connecting type II [@DXS genes#Gene*] to specialized isoprenoid biosynthesis in the fruit of an agronomically important species.
Two HDR paralogues were shown to encode functional enzymes, although only CmHDR1 was highly expressed in the tissues and developmental stages tested.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] showed that in [$cucurbits#Plant*] such as [$melon#Plant*], these HDR paralogues probably arose through individual gene duplications in a common angiosperm ancestor, mimicking a prior division in gymnosperms, while other flowering plants, including [$apple#Plant*], [@soy#Plant*], [$canola#Plant*], and [@poplar#Plant*], acquired HDR duplicates recently as homoeologues through large-scale genome duplications.
We report the influence of gene duplication history on the regulation of the MEP pathway in [$melon#Plant*] and the role of specialized MEP-pathway isoforms in providing precursors for beta-carotene production in orange-fleshed [$melon#Plant*] varieties.
