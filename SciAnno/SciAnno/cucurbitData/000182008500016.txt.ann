[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) has emerged as an important [$pathogen#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] within the last few years in Hungary.
The Hungarian isolates show a high biological variability, have specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences in the N-terminal region of [$coat protein#Gene*] and form a distinct branch in the [$phylogenetic tree#Method*].
The virus is spread very efficiently in the field by several [@aphid species#Virus*] in a non-persistent manner.
It can be transmitted by seed in holl-less seeded oil [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita pepo (L) var Styriaca#Plant*]), although at a very low rate.
Three isolates from [@seed transmission assay experiments #Method*]were chosen and their nucleotide sequences of [@coat proteins#Gene*] have been compared with the available [$CP#Gene*] sequences of [$ZYMV#Virus*].
According to the [@sequence analysis#Method*], the Hungarian isolates belong to the Central Euro[$pea#Plant*]n [$bran#Plant*]ch in the [$phylogenetic tree#Method*] and, together with the [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates from Austria and Slovenia, share specific amino acids at positions 16, 17, 27 and 37 which are characteristic only to these isolates.
The [$phylogenetic tree#Method*] suggests the common origin of distantly distributed isolates which can be attributed to widespread seed transmission.
