A Web site has been set up on the internet to provide a compilation of current botanical information on the family Cucurbitaceae.
This includes a general classification and taxonomy of the hierarchical levels down to species, subspecies, variety, and cultivar.
Descriptions and economic uses of the taxa are given along with digitized images of the plants.
Also provided are literature references and links to other web sites.
The Cucurbit Network hosts the site at the URL: http://www.cucurbit.org/species.html.
The maintenance and comprehensiveness of the site depend on a global collaborative effort of contributors.
