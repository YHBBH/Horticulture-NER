Severe epidemics of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] caused by [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] have been observed in recent years in major [$cucumber#Plant*]-producing regions in Kazakhstan.
However, information on the [$pathogen#Virus*]ic variability of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]that could facilitate screening of candidate [$cucumber#Plant*] varieties and hybrids prior to deployment for commercial production is currently not available.
A total of 112 isolates were collected from 2014 to 2016 during surveys in three major [$cucumber#Plant*]-producing regions of Kazakhstan.
Single lesion isolates were tested for their compatibility with a differential host set composed of 12 genotypes.
Most isolates were compatible with [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] and [$C.melo#Plant*] subsp.
melo, while none were compatible with [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*].
Isolates differed primarily by their virulence to [@C.pepo subsp.pepo#Plant*] and [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*].
Based on the patterns of compatibility with the differential host set, 29 pathotypes were identified.
Of these, 18 were associated with a specific production region, six occurred in two regions and five were present in all three regions.
The number of virulence factors (VF) ranged from 2 to 10, with 65% of the pathotypes having eight or more VFs.
Indices of diversity showed that virulence was very diverse within the [$pathogen#Virus*] populations.
Clustering of pathotypes based on similarity in virulence showed the existence of two main clusters.
The high [$pathogen#Virus*]ic variability observed in this study suggests that newly developed [$cucumber#Plant*] varieties and hybrids with resistance to [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] need to be evaluated against a wide range of pathotypes prior to their deployment for commercial production in Kazakhstan.
