Thirty-seven species within [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] representing the genera [$Citrullus#Plant*], [$Cucumis#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*], [$Lagenaria#Plant*], and [$Luffa#Plant*] were evaluated for disease reaction to an [$Acremonium cucurbitacearum#Virus*] A.Alfaro-Garcia, W.Gams, and Garcia-Jimenez, isolate (TX 941022) from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
After 28 days in the greenhouse, seedling disease ratings were made on the hypocotyl, stem-rootjunction, primary root, and secondary roots.
An additional disease measure was derived by averaging the four root disease ratings to establish a [$disease severity index (DSI)#Method*].
Vine and root dry weight were poor measures of plant damage caused by [@A.cucurbitacearum#Virus*], According to the [$DSI#Method*], all species within[$ Cucurbita#Plant*], [$Lagenaria#Plant*], [$Luffa#Plant*], and three [@Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]
cultigens were rated as highly resistant to [@A.cucurbitacearum#Virus*], [$Cucumis melo L#Plant*].
and [$Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum#Plant*].
& Nakai cultigens were the only [$cucurbits#Plant*] receiving [$DSI#Method*] ratings of moderately resistant to susceptible.
