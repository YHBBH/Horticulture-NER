Description of the subject.
The intercropping system is a beneficial method, which is widely used in tropical areas for sustainable soil fertility management, and has been found to improve both the yields of traditional agriculture and the income of small producers.
   Objectives.
The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effect of associated culture and pure culture of cucurbit Lagenaria siceraria creeping plant and the variety of cassava Manihot esculenta var.
'Bonoua Blanc' upright plant on the agronomic performance of each crop.
   Method.
An experiment was established in randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment.
The treatments compared were firstly, associated crops M.
esculenta var.
'Bonoua Blanc' / L.
siceraria with cucurbit seedlings at 0 days (CAT(0)), 15 days (CAT(15)), 30 days (CAT(30)) and 45 days (CAT(45)) after cassava; secondly, pure cultures of cucurbit on the same dates as for associated crops (CPT0, CPT15, CPT30 and CPT45), and thirdly, a pure culture of cassava at 0 days (CP).
Nine agronomic characteristics were analyzed in cucurbit and eight in cassava.
   Results.
The agronomic parameters evaluated were the yield components of cassava, which varied with the increase in seedling time of cucurbit.
However, the performance of cucurbit decreased with the increase in seedlings either in the associated crop or in pure culture.
Performance also decreased sharply for the same sowing dates in pure culture.
Despite high productivity when cucurbit was simultaneously planted with cassava, it remained low compared to the cucurbit pure crop.
   Conclusions.
Intercropping of cucurbit L.
siceraria and cassava M.
esculenta was not found to be beneficial to the yield of the individual crops.
However, the use of cucurbit as an intercropping cover crop helps to conserve soil moisture and to manage arable land and weeds for the benefit of cassava crops.
