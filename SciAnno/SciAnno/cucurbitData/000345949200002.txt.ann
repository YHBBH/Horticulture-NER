[@Oriental melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo var.makuwa Makino#Plant*]) is a fruit with distinctive characteristics that is grown in Fuzhou, China.
[@Fusarium wilt disease#Disease*] management remains a major challenge in the production of this fruit.
Here, we performed seven field trials at four locations in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China, to evaluate the control of fusarium wilt and yield of [$Oriental melon#Plant*]s grafted on two[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstocks [Shengyan Tianzhen (SYTZ) and Nanzhen No.
1 (NZ1)].
During the growing seasons of 2008 to 2011, [$Oriental melon#Plant*]s grafted on SYTZ and NZ1 exhibited dramatically reduced incidences of fusarium wilt disease and increased yields compared with nongrafted [$Oriental melon#Plant*]s.
Disease was only recorded in Trial 3 at Hongwei (2009), where plants grafted on SYTZ and NZ1 exhibited 1.05% and 1.1% infection, respectively.
In the other six field trials, wilting was not observed at all.
In comparison, the incidence of the disease in nongrafted [$Oriental melon#Plant*]s ranged from 45.0% to 100.0%.
The use of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] [$rootstocks#Plant*] improved the qualitative and quantitative carotenoid profiles, increasing lutein levels (12.7 and 10.8 mu,g.g(-1) of fresh weight, respectively) and zeta-carotene and phytofluene amounts in fruit samples from SYTZ- and NZ1-grafted plants.
In particular, the Liyu/NZ1 combination significantly increased beta-carotene content approximate to 4-fold compared with nongrafted samples.
In conclusion,[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstocks provided acceptable protection of [$Oriental melon#Plant*] cv.Liyu against fusarium wilt and improved the productivity and quality of fruits.
