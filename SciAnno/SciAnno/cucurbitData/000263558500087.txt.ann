In this study we describe the inhibitory effect exerted by developing [@cucumber#Plant*] fruits on later-developing ovaries.
Such pollinated ovaries do not set fruit but do not degenerate readily, remaining in a "stand-by" state that can be reversed when older fruits are removed.
An increase in fruit set and decrease in inhibition was obtained by exogenous gibberellin and cytokinin treatment, and to a lesser extent by auxin.
A decrease in transcript levels of genes expressed during fruit set was apparent in inhibited ovaries.
