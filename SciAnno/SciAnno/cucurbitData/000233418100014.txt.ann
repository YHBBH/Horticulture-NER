[@Bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([@BFB#Disease*]), caused by [$Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], is a serious disease of [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
The first important occurrence of [$BFB#Disease*] in Israel was during 2000 to 2003 on [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*].
Twelve bacterial isolates associated with these outbreaks were confirmed as [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] by[@ pathogenicity assays, gas chromatography of fatty-acid methyl esters, and substrate-utilization profiles#Method*].
The isolates were characterized in terms of their aggressiveness in different hosts by seed, seedling, and fruit inoculations, and according to their DNA fingerprinting profiles [@using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and repetitive-PCR approaches#Method*].
Results from the present work agree with previous studies supporting the existence of two differentiated groups within [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], one including strains that are more associated with [$watermelon#Plant*] (group II), the other consisting of strains that are usually associated with non[$watermelon#Plant*] [$cucurbits#Plant*] (group I).
This study indicates that isolates from both groups have been introduced to Israel.
[@PFGE analysis #Method*]revealed that the 12 analyzed isolates can be divided into five different haplotypes, of which four were previously unreported.
Additional differentiating features between group I and II strains are presented.
