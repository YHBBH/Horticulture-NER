In the world, one of the biggest problems of melon production is[@ powdery mildew disease#Disease*] (Robinson and Decker-Walters 1997).
[$Powdery mildew#Disease*] is usually the most common disease of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and easily identifiable.
Plants are infected with the disease agent in hot and dry weather (Robinson and Decker-Walters 1997).
Besides controlling of the disease with the chemicals, to use disease-resistant varieties are seen as the best solution (Hosoya 1999).
   Identifying of [$melon#Plant*] genotypes reactions to the disease is important.
A test method is needed to optimize in our conditions for the development of resistant varieties.
In the world, a leaf disc method used for the[$ powdery mildew disease#Disease*] in [$melon#Plant*] (Pitrat et al.
1991).
We used this method in our laboratory.
But leaf discs were not consistently achieving the desired results due to the contaminations.
   Therefore, we used greenhouse compartments in Vegetable Department of Bati Akdeniz Agricultural Research Institute, to realized pot tests in vivo.
[$Melon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] which are 3-4 true leaves are sprayed with a liquid spore suspension containing 5x10(6) spores/ml of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
Tested plants are incubated under the average temperature 26, 9 degrees C and 60,8 % of humidity.
The first symptoms of sensitive plants were seen on the leaves at 9 days, Assessments can be done on the leaves, at the end of 15 days.
   In vivo test results are evaluated according to the 1-4 scale of Yuste-Lisbona et al.
(2010).
In vivo tests which developed in our conditions were more quickly, less labor and less cost then the leaf disc method.
The results are clearly seen.
In conclusion, in vivo pot tests against to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] of [$melon#Plant*] can be easily applied to the resistant disease breeding studies.
