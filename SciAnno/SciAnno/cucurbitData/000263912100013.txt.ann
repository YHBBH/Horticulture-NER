Surveys for virus and virus-like plant diseases were conducted on the islands of Guadalcanal, Malaita, Ndende and Temon Neo in the Solomon Islands.
New plant virus records for the country were those of [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) in [@Citrulus lanatus#Plant*] ([$watermelon#Plant*]), [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] ([$pumpkin#Plant*]), [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] ([@rockmelon#Plant*]) and [@Cucumis sativas #Plant*]( [$cucumber#Plant*]); [@Turnip mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@TuMV#Virus*]) in [@Brassica chinensis#Plant*] ([$Chinese cabbage#Plant*]); [$Tomato mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@ToMV#Virus*]) in [@Capsicum annuum var.annuum#Plant*] ([@chilli#Plant*]) and [$Solanum lycopersicum#Plant*] ([$tomato#Plant*]); and [$Tobacco mosaic virus#Disease*] ([$TMV#Virus*]) in [@S.lycopersicum#Plant*], all detected by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]).
[$Phytoplasma#Virus*]s belonging to the 'Candidatus [$Phytoplasma#Virus*] aurantifolia' (16SrII) group were detected by nested [$PCR#Method*] in Celosia argen[$tea#Plant*] and B.chinensis.
New virus host records, detected by [$ELISA#Method*], were those of the [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting strain of [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) in [$C.maxima#Plant*] and [@C.sativa#Plant*];[@ Bean common mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@ BCMV#Virus*]) in [@Vigna unguiculata ssp.unguiculata#Plant*] ([@snakebean#Plant*]) and [@Passiflora foetida#Plant*]; and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) in [@Ruellia prostrata#Plant*], [@Synedrella nodifora#Plant*] and [@Nicotiana tabaccum#Plant*] ([$tobacco#Plant*]).
Other detections using [$ELISA#Method*] were those of [$CMV#Virus*] in [@C.annuum var.annuum#Plant*] and [$S.lycopersicum#Plant*].
No evidence was found for presence of [$citrus #Plant*]huanglongbing, previously known as [$greening disease#Disease*].
Seven [$citrus #Plant*][$trees#Plant*] indexed negative by [$PCR#Method*] for the causal agent, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus'.
