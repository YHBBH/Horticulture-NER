[@Monosporascus cannonballus#Virus*] and [$M.eutypoides#Virus*] are recently described soilborne ascomycetes that cause [$root rot#Disease*]/[$vine decline#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from the representative isolates of the two species were amplified by [@polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using conserved ITS primers from conserved regions of the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal genes#Method*].
The size of the entire spacer region, including the 5.8S gene, was estimated to be 610 bp based on [@gel electrophoresis of the PCR-amplified product#Method*].
The entire region was cloned into a pUC18 vector, sequenced, and the DNA sequence aligned with published sequences from other fungi to identify gene-spacer junctions.
Comparison to the published sequences of other fungi revealed up to 90% homology at the 3' end of the 18S gene, up to 79% homology with the 5.8S gene and up to 74% homology at the 5' end of the 28S gene.
The DNA sequences (ITS 1 and ITS 2) contained within these regions did not show homology with any published DNA sequences.
The ITS regions from 12 isolates of [@Monosporascus spp.#Virus*]
representing all geographic regions of their reported occurrence were [$PCR#Method*]-amplified and digested singularly with nine restriction enzymes but no length polymorphisms could be detected.
The sequences of the ITS 1 and ITS 2 were used to construct five [$PCR#Method*] primers, each of which was subsequently shown to amplify identical, predicted-size, fragments from the DNA of all 12 [$Monosporascus#Virus*] isolates tested.
[$PCR#Method*] primers from the ITS regions of [@Monosporascus spp.#Virus*]
failed to amplify predicted-size fragments from the DNA of any other soilborne fungi tested including representative species bf the genera considered taxonomically (e.g., Anixiella) and ecologically (e.g., [$Fusarium#Virus*]., [@Stagonospora#Virus*], [@Macrophomina#Virus*], etc.) most closely related to [@Monosporascus spp.#Virus*]
These primers were also tested on the DNA extracted from the roots of [$Monosporascus#Virus*]-infected [$muskmelon#Plant*] and were shown to consistently amplify the predicted-size fragments whose identity was further confirmed by [$Southern hybridization#Method*] to the digoxigenin-labeled portions of the ITS regions.
In addition to establishing that the DNA sequence of the ITS region is conserved within the genus [$Monosporascus#Virus*] this study also illustrates a convenient approach to developing ''molecular tools'' for detection of plant [$pathogen#Virus*]ic fungi without necessarily having any detailed knowledge of their genome organization.
