The utilization of resistant rootstocks to adverse conditions is an alternative on disease control and the grafting has been detached on the soil pathogen inhabitant control of many fruits and [@vegetables#Plant*].
The objective of the present research was the selection of resistantes [$rootstocks#Plant*] to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] and evaluates their effects on production of lancewok [$melon#Plant*].
For the selection of resistance genotypes to [$D.bryoniae#Virus*], was utilized 17 [$cucurbits#Plant*] genotypes.
Only the rootstocks: [@Watermelon Charleston Gray#Plant*] and [@Round Melon Yellow#Plant*] showed susceptible to the [$pathogen#Virus*].
For the production effects, was grafted under resistance genotypes, 'Bonus n(o) 2'.
The Benicia hispid rootstock is the most indicated to [$melon#Plant*].
