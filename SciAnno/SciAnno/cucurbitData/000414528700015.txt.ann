[@Chayote #Plant*]or [@chow-chow#Plant*] is an underutilized [$cucurbit #Plant*][$vegetable#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*], widely cultivated by farmers in the backyards and Jhum lands for its tender leaves, fruits and tuberous root.
In order to initiate [$crop#Plant*] improvement program in this [$crop#Plant*], the present study was undertaken to assess the genetic variations in the 74 [$chow-chow#Plant*] landraces collected from the North Eastern Hill region of India.
Wide variations for fruit colors, fruit length (6.5-21.5 cm), fruit width (4.2-10.7 cm), fruit weight (60-560 g), vitamin-C (2.6-13.8 mg/100 g), reducing sugar (0.18-2.77%), total sugar (1.09-2.94%) and phenol content (0.17-3.85 mg/100 g FW) were recorded among the landraces.
All the landraces were also characterized using [$random amplified polymorphic DNA#Method*] ([$RAPD#Method*]) and [@inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers#Method*].
In [$RAPD#Method*] analyses, out of 28 primers a total of 198 reproducible amplicons were formed at an average of 7.01 per primer and an overall polymorphism of 88.38%.
Eight fragments were specific to landraces with light green fruits.
Four fragments were observed to be specific to RCSC-22 (dark green fruits) and another four specific to a RCSC-30 (pale yellow fruits).
Out of 30 ISSR, only 5 primers generated a total of 32 reproducible amplicons with an average of 6.4 per primer and overall polymorphism of 62.5%.
The pair wise similarity coefficient values ranged from 0.55 to 0.96.
The grouping of landraces in [$cluster analysis#Method*] was found to be independent of their respective geographic locations.
The cuttings of suckers and shoot top (2 months old) treated with indole-3-butyric acid (200 mg l(-1)) provide an alternative for the conservation of the diverse genetic materials to the researchers.
