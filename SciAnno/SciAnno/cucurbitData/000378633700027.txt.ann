Attention to off-season vegetables production has led extension new methods such as fruit vegetable grafting.
In order to study the quality and quantity characters of grafted [$cucumber#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] on different rootstocks this experiment was conducted in Agriculture & natural resources research centre of Isfahan, during 2002-2004.
Scion [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]'Soltan') was grafted onto six different rootstocks namely:[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] ficifolia Bouche 'Fig leaf [$gourd#Virus*]',[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] 'Mosamaii', [$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]var.flexuosus 'Chanbar', [$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]var.eticulates 'Talebi', [$Cucumis sativus L#Plant*].
'Dastgerdi' and [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] '[$Watermelon#Plant*]', and non-grafted [$cucumber#Plant*] 'Soltan' as control.
Results showed that early flowering (10 day) and precocity (5 day) was higher than rootstock on 'Mosamaii'.
The fruit yield of 'Fig leaf [$gourd#Virus*]', 'Mosamaii', non-grafted control 'Soltan', 'Talebi', 'Chanbar', 'Dastgerdi' and '[$Watermelon#Plant*]', were 3.1, 2.3, 1.8, 1.6, 1.5, 0.9 and 0.4 (kg/plant), respectively.
Survival rate of rootstocks were 88, 69, 49, 42, 27 and 18% for 'Mosamaii', 'Fig leaf [$gourd#Virus*]', 'Chanbar', 'Talebi', 'Dastgerdi' and '[$Watermelon#Plant*]', respectively.
Grafting system in this study with [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks were limited by fruit quality and should be carried out carefully.
The overall results of this experiment shows that the most suitable rootstocks for grafting were [$pumpkin#Plant*] 'Fig leaf [$gourd#Virus*]' and [$squash #Plant*]'Mosamaii'.
