During the 2009, 2010, and 2011 growing seasons, disease prevalence and severity and the host range of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], the causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], were evaluated at more than 70 locations in two main regions of the Czech Republic.
Infection by [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was observed primarily on [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], rarely on other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Medium to high disease-severity levels were most frequently recorded on [$C.sativus#Plant*].
During the years 2010 and 2011, [$P.cubensis #Virus*]infection was also recorded on [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] and [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*].
Occurrence of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]on [$C.melo#Plant*] and [$C.lanatus#Plant*] has been formerly reported from the Czech Republic, however, infection on [$C.moschata#Plant*] was observed for the first time in the Czech Republic in 2009.
In the years 2010 and 2011, four new hosts ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*], [@Cucurbita ficifolia#Plant*] and [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]were found in the Czech Republic.
   Virulence structure and its temporal changes (2010 to 2011) were studied in populations of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]in the Czech Republic.Seventy [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates, collected from [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] and melo,[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima, pepo, and moschata, and [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], were analyzed for virulence variation.
The variation of [$pathogen#Virus*] populations was expressed by the designation of pathotypes using tetrad numerical codes.
The most susceptible group of differentials was [$Cucumis#Plant*] species; in contrast, the lowest frequency of [$pathogenicity#Plant*] was recorded on[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] subsp.pepo, [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] and [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*].
A high proportion of Czech [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates were able to infect two [$cucurbit species#Plant*], [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*] and [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*], that are not commonly cultivated in the Czech Republic or elsewhere in Central Europe.
In this study period (2009-2011), there were substantial changes to the [$pathogen#Virus*] virulence structure in comparison with the period 2001-2008.
