The thrips-borne [@Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([$MYSV#Virus*]) has recently been found infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Taiwan.
However, this virus was indistinguishable from another [@thrips-borne virus#Virus*] species [$Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] ([$WSMoV#Virus*]), which has been devastating on [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Taiwan for decades, when the antisera against their [$nucleocapsid protein#Gene*]s (NPs) were used for diagnosis.
To understand the incidences of [$WSMoV#Virus*] and [$MYSV#Virus*] in [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] fields, a survey was conducted in central and southern Taiwan from July 2007 to December 2009.
The samples collected from symptomatic plants were tested by indirect [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to the NP of [$WSMoV#Virus*] or [$MYSV#Virus*] and the reliability of the results was verified by [@reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using species-specific primers#Method*].
Among a total of 10,480 [$melon#Plant*] samples collected, 6% and 18.2% of them were found singly infected with [$WSMoV#Virus*] and [$MYSV#Virus*], respectively, and 0.16% infected with both viruses.
On the other hand, among 1,811 [$watermelon#Plant*] samples assayed, 22.4% and 9.2% samples were singly infected with [$WSMoV#Virus*] and [$MYSV#Virus*], respectively, and 0.17% were infected with both viruses.
In addition, the [@aphid-borne viruses#Virus*] [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] [$watermelon#Plant*] type ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) were also detected as prevalent viruses.
Our results indicated that mixed infection with the two [$thrips-borne virus#Virus*]es is rare.
Moreover, host preference for both viruses is different; [$WSMoV#Virus*] prevails on [$watermelon#Plant*] whereas [$MYSV#Virus*] is more widespread on [$melon#Plant*].
We conclude that [$MYSV#Virus*] has become a serious threat for [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] production in Taiwan and the possible control measures are discussed.
