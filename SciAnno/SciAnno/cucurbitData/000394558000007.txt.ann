[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) induces serious diseases in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
To create a tool to screen for resistance genes, we cloned a wild [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolate and inserted the visual marker Roseal to obtain recombinant clone [$ZYMV#Virus*]-Rosl.
While in some plant-virus combinations Roseal induces accumulation of anthocyanins in infected tissues, [$ZYMV#Virus*]-Rosl infection of [$cucurbits#Plant*] did not lead to detectable anthocyanin accumulation.
However, the recombinant virus did induce dark red pigmen-tation in infected tissues of the model plant [@Nicotiana ben-thamiana#Plant*].
In this species, [$ZYMV#Virus*]-Rosl multiplied efficiently in local inoculated tissue but only a few progeny particles estab-lished infection foci in upper leaves.
We used this system to analyze the roles of [@Dicer-like (DCL) genes#Gene*], core components of plant antiviral RNA silencing pathways, in [$ZYMV#Virus*] infection.
[$ZYMV#Virus*]-Rosl local replication was not significantly affected in single [@DCL#Gene*] knockdown lines nor in double [@DCL2/4#Gene*] and triple [@DCL2/3/4#Gene*] knockdown lines.
[$ZYMV#Virus*]-Rosl systemic accumula-tion was not affected in knockdown lines [@DCL1#Gene*], [@DCL2#Gene*], and [@DCL3#Gene*].
However in [@DCL4#Gene*] and also in [$DCL2/4#Gene*] and [$DCL2/3/4#Gene*] knockdown lines, [$ZYMV#Virus*]-Rosl systemic accumulation dra-matically increased, which highlights the key role of [$DCL4#Gene*] in restricting virus systemic movement.
The effect of [$DCL4#Gene*] on [$ZYMV#Virus*] systemic movement was confirmed with a wild-type version of the virus.
