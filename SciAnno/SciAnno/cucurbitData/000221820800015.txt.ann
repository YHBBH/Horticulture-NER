Chromosome studies and in situ estimation of 4C nuclear DNA content were carried out on dioecious [@Coccinia indica#Plant*] and [$Trichosanthes dioica#Plant*] to understand the differential condensation of mitotic chromosome in relation to sex.
The somatic chromosome number for each sex form of [@C indica#Plant*] and [@T dioica#Plant*] was found to be 2n = 24 and 22 respectively.
The karyotypes of the sex forms of both species show high homogeneity, though a distinct hetermorphic pair of sex chromosomes is found in [$male plants#Plant*] of [@C.indica#Plant*].
Interrelationship between the 4C nuclear content and the chromosome length has been explained in terms of average packing ratio.
The data suggests that average packing ratio is a determinant of distinction between two sexes and therefore could be used as a parameter for analyzing the karyotypes of dioecious plants.
