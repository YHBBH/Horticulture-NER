   [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] causes some of the most devastating diseases of [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*], while [$P.humuli#Virus*] is an important [$pathogen#Virus*] of hop (Cannabaceae).
Although parasitic to different Angiosperm orders, these [$pathogens#Virus*] are highly similar, both in morphology and based on molecular comparisons.
Considering the close relationship of [$P.humuli#Virus*] and [$P.cubensis#Virus*], it was hypothesized that cross infectivity of the [$pathogens#Virus*] between their optimum hosts might be possible.
Two strains of [$P.humuli#Virus*] and one of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]used in this study were able to reproduce on the two wild [$cucurbit #Plant*]relatives [$Bryonia dioica#Plant*] and [$Sicyos angulatus#Plant*].
Interestingly, limited infectivity of the [$P.cubensis #Virus*]strain to hop was also observed, and the [$P.humuli#Virus*] strain was also able to infest [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*].
The cross infections were verified by comparing the nuclear ribosomal-internal transcribed spacer sequences of newly produced sporangiophores from the different hosts.
Morphologically the two [$pathogens#Virus*] could be distinguished by statistical analyses on their original hosts but these differences diminished on some alternate hosts.
The ability of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]to infest the perennial [$Bryonia dioica#Plant*] and [@Humulus lupulus#Plant*] might offer a limited possibility for overwintering in temperate regions and needs to be evaluated in future studies.
The ability of [$P.humuli#Virus*] to complete its life cycle on all the tested [$cucurbits#Plant*] provides evidence that the host jump across orders may continue and points to the high virulence potential of this [$pathogen#Virus*].
