[@Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] is the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]), a threatening disease of [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Despite the economic importance of [$BFB#Disease*], relatively little is known about basic aspects of the [$pathogen#Virus*]'s biology and the molecular basis of its interaction with [$host plants#Plant*].
To identify [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] genes associated with [$pathogenicity#Plant*], we generated a transposon (Tn5) mutant library on the background of strain M6, a group I strain of [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], and screened it for reduced virulence by seed-transmission assays with [$melon#Plant*].
Here, we report the identification of a Tn5 mutant with reduced virulence that is impaired in pilM, which encodes a protein involved in assembly of type IV pili (TFP).
Further characterization of this mutant revealed that [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] requires TFP for twitching motility and wild-type levels of biofilm formation.
Significant reductions in virulence and biofilm formation as well as abolishment of twitching were also observed in insertional mutants affected in other TFP genes.
We also provide the first evidence that group I strains of [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] can colonize and move through host xylem vessels.
