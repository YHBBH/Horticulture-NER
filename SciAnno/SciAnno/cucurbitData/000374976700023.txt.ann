Since 2008, severe diseas epidemics with symptoms resembling [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] have occurred on [$gherkin#Plant*] [$cucumbers#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) in Karnataka, India.
Three morphologically identical, but genetically distinct, [$Stagonosporopsis#Virus*] species, namely: [$Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum#Virus*] ([$syn.Didymella bryoniae#Virus*]), [@Stagonosporopsis citrulli#Virus*], and [@Stagonosporopsis caricae#Virus*], can cause [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Our objective was to use[@ molecular techniques #Method*]to identify if one or more of these species caused the recent epidemics on [@gherkin#Plant*].
It is not known which of these species is causing [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in India.
Based on the original host species, disease symptoms, fulfilment of Koch's postulates, and macroscopic and microscopic morphological analysis, the causal agent was tentatively identified as [@Stagonosporopsis sp.#Virus*]
To identify which species was responsible, nine isolates were obtained from the outbreaks on [$gherkin#Plant*] in two regions of Karnataka in October and November 2014.
The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the riboso[@mal DN#Plant*]A was sequenced, and a previously developed [$PCR#Method*]-based marker for distinguishing species causing [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] was used to identify the species of the isolates.
We determined that seven of the isolates were [$S.caricae#Virus*] and two were [$S.citrulli#Virus*].
This is the first account in India that at least two [$Stagonosporopsis#Virus*] species are causing [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*], and are substantial threats to [$gherkin#Plant*] productivity and other [$cucurbits#Plant*] in India.
