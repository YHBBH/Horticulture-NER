[@Begomoviruses#Virus*] represent one of the most damaging virus groups on many important [$crops#Plant*] worldwide.
In Venezuela, the [$begomovirus#Virus*] [$Melon chlorotic mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MeCMV#Virus*]) is the major constraint for [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] production.
[$MeCMV#Virus*] has been associated with the satellite [$Melon#Plant*] chlorotic mosaic alphasatellite (MeCMA).
Full-length genome sequencing of 20 and 35 isolates of [$MeCMV#Virus*] and MeCMA, respectively, was carried out to estimate their genetic variability.
Furthermore, mechanical transmission assays of [$MeCMV#Virus*] alone, or in conjunction with MeCMA, were performed.
Genetic variation was low among [$MeCMV#Virus*] isolates, which exhibited 97-100% nucleotide identity for the DNA-A component and 95-100% for the DNA-B component.
Alphasatellite isolates were highly variable ranging from 86.5 to 100% nucleotide identity.
[$MeCMV#Virus*] isolates were phylogenetically related to [$begomoviruses#Virus*] belonging to the [$Squash leaf curl virus#Plant*] ([$SLCV#Virus*]) clade, while MeCMA isolates were clustered in two subgroups related to alphasatellites from the New World (Cuba and Brazil).
[$MeCMV#Virus*] has a host range restricted to [$cucurbit species #Plant*]and two experimental hosts: [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] and [$Nicotiana#Plant*] clevelandii.
[$MeCMV#Virus*] can be mechanically transmitted with up to 100% efficiency in [$melon#Plant*].
The physiological stage of the inoculated organ (cotyledon or leaf) represents a key factor for inoculation efficiency.
This result provides a simple and reliable inoculation method to develop extensive screening for [$MeCMV#Virus*] resistance sources.
In addition, the complex [$MeCMV#Virus*] + MeCMA was mechanically transmitted to [$melon#Plant*], N.benthamiana and N.clevelandii [$plantlets#Plant*] and successfully back-transmitted.
To the authors' knowledge, this finding is the first evidence of sap transmission for a [$begomovirus#Virus*]-satellite complex.
