Fruit development proceeds from cell division to expansion, maturation, and ripening.
Expansion is critical for size, yield, and quality; however, this period of development has received little attention.
We used 454-pyrosequencing to develop a [@cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) fruit transcriptome, identify highly expressed transcripts, and characterize key functions during exponential fruit growth.
The resulting 187,406 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were assembled into 13,878 contigs.
[@Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([@qRT-PCR#Method*]) verification of differentially expressed genes from fruit of different ages, and high correlation in transcript frequency between replicates, indicated that number of reads/contig reflects transcript abundance.
Putative homologs were identified in [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] thulium, for 89% of the contigs represented by at least 10 ESTs; another 4% had homologs in other species.
The remainder had homologs only in [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
The most highly expressed contigs were strongly enriched for growth (aquaporins, vacuolar ATPase, phloem proteins, tubulins, actins, cell wall-associated, and hormone-related), lipid, [$latex#Plant*], and defense-related homologs.
These results provide a resource for gene expression analysis in [$cucumber#Plant*], profile gene expression in rapidly growing fruit, and shed insight into an important, but poorly characterized, developmental stage influencing fruit yield and quality.
