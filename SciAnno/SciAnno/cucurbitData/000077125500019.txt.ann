Conspicuous, unusual nuclear inclusions in stained epidermal strips of leaves implicated a virus (designated isolate 2932) as the cause of [@foliar mosaic#Virus*] in a [$watermelon#Plant*] plant ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) received for analysis from South Florida in 1990.
In greenhouse tests, mechanically inoculated plants of [$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] ([@Small Sugar pumpkin#Plant*] and [@Early Prolific Straightneck squash#Plant*]) and [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Crimson Seet#Plant*]) developed mosaic or mottle symptoms.
Isolate 2932 caused foliar symptoms in 16 cultivars of [$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], including Freedom II and Prelude II, and in six cultivars of [$watermelon#Plant*].
None of five cultivars of [$melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo#Plant*]) or 11 cultivars of [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) developed consistent, distinctive symptoms, but all of these cultivars were systemically infected based on back-inoculations to [$squash#Plant*].
No systemic infection of mechanically inoculated plants of 25 species representing 13 non[$cucurbit#Plant*]aceous plant families was detected.
Crystalline nuclear inclusions, cytoplasmic amorphous inclusions, and cytoplasmic cylindrical inclusions were detected by light and electron microscopy in leaf tissues of infected [$squash#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*].
[@Electron microscopy#Method*] of [$squash#Plant*] leaf extracts revealed filamentous particles, and 86% of 159 particles measured ranged from 800 to 890 nm in length.
The virus was transmitted in a nonpersistent manner by Myzus persicae from [$squash#Plant*] to [$squash#Plant*] in two of three trials.
[@Immunodiffusion tests#Method*] with polyclonal antisera prepared to partially purified 2932 or its capsid protein showed that the isolate was antigenically different from [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] type W, [@watermelon mosaic virus 2#Virus*], and [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*].
In limited testing of field samples of [$squash#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] since 1990, no additional isolates of the 2932 type have been found.
The characteristics of isolate 2932 obtained thus far indicate that it is a distinct potyvirus.
It is tentatively named [$watermelon#Plant*] leaf mottle virus to distinguish it from other potyviruses commonly isolated from [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Florida.
