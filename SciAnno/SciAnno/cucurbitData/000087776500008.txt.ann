DL-3-aminobutyric acid (BABA), a non-protein amino acid, was found to induce resistance in [@melons#Plant*] and [$cucumbers#Plant*] against [$downy mildew#Disease*] caused by the [@fungus Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*].
BABA also protected [$melons#Plant*] against [@the wilt fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.
melonis#Virus*].
The 2- and 3-aminobutyric acid isomers were not effective.
BABA reduced disease intensity in different application forms (foliar spray, soil drench, leaf discs) while not showing fugicidal activity in vitro.
