In [@glasshouse experiments#Method*], [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) was transmitted from infected to healthy [$zucchini#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) plants by direct contact when leaves were rubbed against each other, crushed, or trampled, and, to a lesser extent, on [$ZYMV#Virus*]-contaminated blades.
When sap from [$zucchini#Plant*] plants infected with three [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates was kept at room temperature for up to 6 h, it infected healthy plants readily.
Also, when sap from [$ZYMV#Virus*]-infected leaves was applied to seven surfaces ([$cotton#Plant*], plastic, leather, metal, rubber vehicle tire, rubber-soled footwear, and human skin) and left for up to 48 h before the [$ZYMV#Virus*]-contaminated surface was rubbed onto healthy [$zucchini#Plant*] plants, [$ZYMV#Virus*] remained infective for 48 h on tire, 24 h on plastic and leather, and up to 6 h on [$cotton#Plant*], metal, and footwear.
On human skin, [$ZYMV#Virus*] remained infective for 5 min only.
The effectiveness of 13 disinfectants at inactivating [$ZYMV#Virus*] was evaluated by adding them to sap from [$ZYMV#Virus*]-infected leaves Which was then rubbed on to healthy [$zucchini#Plant*] plants.
None of the plants became infected when nonfat dried milk (20%, wt/vol) or bleach (sodium hypochlorite at 42 g/liter, diluted 1:4) were used.
When [$ZYMV#Virus*]-infected [$pumpkin#Plant*] leaves were trampled by footwear and then used to trample healthy plants, all plants became infected; however, when contaminated footwear was dipped in a footbath containing bleach (sodium hypochlorite at 42 g/liter, diluted 1:4) before trampling, none became infected.
This study demonstrates that [$ZYMV#Virus*] can be transmitted by contact and highlights the need for on-farm hygiene practices (decontaminating tools, machinery, clothing, and so on) to be included in integrated disease management strategies for [$ZYMV#Virus*] in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
