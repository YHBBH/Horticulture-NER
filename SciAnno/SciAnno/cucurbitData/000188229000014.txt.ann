[@Downy mildew#Disease*] caused by the oomycete [$pathogen#Virus*] [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] is a devastating foliar disease of [$cucurbits#Plant*]; worldwide.
We previously demonstrated that the wild [$melon#Plant*] line PI 12411F IF (PI) is highly resistant to all pathotypes of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
That resistance was controlled genetically by two partially dominant, complementary loci.
Here, we show that unlike other plant disease resistance genes, which confer an ability to resist infection by [$pathogens#Virus*] expressing corresponding avirulence genes, the resistance of PI to [$P.cubensis #Virus*]is controlled by enhanced expression of the enzymatic resistance (eR) genes At1 and At2.
These constitutively expressed genes encode the photorespiratory peroxisomal enzyme proteins glyoxylate aminotransferases.
The low expression of At1 and At2 in susceptible [$melon#Plant*] lines is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level.
This regulation is independent of infection with the [$pathogen#Virus*].
Transgenic [$melon#Plant*] plants overexpressing either of these [@eR genes#Gene*] displayed enhanced activity of glyoxylate aminotransferases and remarkable resistance against [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
The cloned [$eR genes#Gene*] provide a new resource for developing [$downy mildew#Disease*]-resistant [$melon#Plant*] varieties.
