The oomycete [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] is a leaf [$pathogen#Virus*] causing severe damage to members of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], especially [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*].
It propagates clonally by sporangia.
Oospores of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]were previously observed in nature but their formation in the laboratory was never reported nor their germination or infection.
Here we report on the sexual reproduction of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]under controlled conditions in the laboratory.
When field isolates were inoculated singly onto detached leaves of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in growth chambers no oospores were produced.
However, when pairs of selected isolates were mixed and inoculated onto detached leaves, ospores were formed in the mesophyll within 6-11 days, suggesting that [$P.cubensis #Virus*]is heterothallic, having two opposite mating types, A1 and A2.
Isolates belonging to pathotype 3 were all A1 whereas isolates belonging to the new pathotype 6 were either A1 or A2.
Oospores were spherical, similar to 40 mu m in diameter, hyaline to red-brown in color.
Oospores were produced regularly, in large numbers, in [@Cucumis sativum #Plant*]and [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], very seldom and in very small numbers in [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] and [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], and not in [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*].
Oospores were formed at 12.5-21 degrees C but not at 25 degrees C.
Under moisture-saturated atmosphere oospores were also produced in leaves of intact plants.
Oospores inoculated onto detached leaves in growth chambers produced F1 [$downy mildew#Virus*] lesions at 6-21 days after inoculation, many in [@Cucumis sativum#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*], very few in[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] pepo or [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], and none in [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*].
This report shows that [$P.cubensis #Virus*]is heterothallic, having A1 and A2 mating types which can cross and enable sexual reproduction in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
A preliminary report on part of the results has been published earlier.
