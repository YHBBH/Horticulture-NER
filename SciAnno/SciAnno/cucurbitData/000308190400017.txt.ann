Backgroud and aims [@Powdery mildew#Disease*] elicited by [$Podosphaera fusca#Virus*] is an important threat to [$cucurbits#Plant*].
In order to find alternatives to the current use of chemicals, we examined the potential use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria ([$PGPR#Virus*]) for controlling the disease by induction of systemic resistance in the host plant.
   Methods A collection of [@Bacillus#Virus*] and [@Pseudomonas#Virus*] strains from different origins was studied, including strains isolated from roots of disease-free [$melon plants#Plant*] obtained from a greenhouse plagued by[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
The selection of best candidates was based on the evaluation of different traits commonly associated with [$PGPR#Virus*], such as antifungal and siderophore production, swimming and swarming motilities, biofilm formation, auxin production and promotion of root development.
   Results Three [$Bacillus#Virus*] strains, [$B.subtilis#Virus*] UMAF6614 and UMAF6639 and [$B.cereus#Virus*] UMAF8564, and two [$Pseudomonas#Virus*] fluorescens strains, UMAF6031 and UMAF6033, were selected after ranking the strains [@using a nonparametric statistics test#Method*].
Applied to [$melon seedlings#Plant*], the selected strains were able to promote plant growth, increasing fresh weight up to 30%.
Furthermore, these strains provided protection against[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] and also against [$angular leaf spot#Disease*] caused by [$Pseudomonas#Virus*] syringae pv.
lachrymans, with disease reductions of up to 60%.
   Conclusions These results suggest that the use of ISR-promoting [$PGPR#Virus*] could be a promising strategy for the integrated control of [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] and other [$cucurbit #Plant*]diseases.
