Although [@Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) is one of the main [$cucurbit #Plant*][$pathogens#Virus*] and has a worldwide distribution, reliable data on its molecular variability is still limited to some geographical regions.
The genetic diversity of 36 [$WMV#Virus*] isolates from Slovakia and Iran were studied by [$sequence analysis#Method*] targeting two opposite genomic regions (PI and NIb-CP).
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] using partial sequences of the PI gene showed that [@Slovak WMV#Virus*] isolates had greater diversity, representing two groups (group I and group 2), whereas all Iranian isolates belonged to a single group (group 2), with relatively low divergeance.
Interestingly, in the NIb-CP region, all analyzed Slovak and Iranian isolates clustered within the group I, thereby illustrating the phylogenetic discrepancies between the two analyzed genomic regions.
Based on these data, one-half of analyzed Slovak isolates and all Iranian [$WMV#Virus*] isolates showed a switch in affiliation based on considered genomic region, clearly indicating their recombinant nature.
This work provides further evidence of the significant contribution of recombination to the evolutionary history of [$WMV#Virus*] and outlines the necessity to target more than a single genome fragment for accurate typing of [$WMV#Virus*] isolates.
