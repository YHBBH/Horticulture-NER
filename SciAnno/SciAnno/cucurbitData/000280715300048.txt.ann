This study contributes to the enhancement of on knowledge about behaviour of [@cucurbits#Plant*] with heavy metal i.e., Pb (NO(3))(2) and/or their combination with growth hormones (IAA).
Effects of Pb and IAA were studied on flowering in [@Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]
and [@Momordica charantia L.#Plant*]
There is very little information on the effects of heavy metals on the flowering in plants particularly in [$cucurbits#Plant*]; this in itself makes the issue of interest apart from the interaction of heavy metals with hormones.
Plant under the stress of heavy metals can be treated with growth hormones to improve growth parameters, to avoid delay in flowering and likewise quality of fruit can be improved.
Applied 400 mg/l IAA caused precocious flowering, increasing the number of flowers in both the plants.
Lead caused significant delay in flowering, consequently leading to reduction in the number of pistillate and staminate flowers.
However, when IAA was applied with Pb (NO(3))(2), there was less decrease in staminate and pistillate flowers, revealing the dominant effect of IAA.
Current study reveals that inhibitory effects of heavy metals on flowering were partially restored by IAA applications.
