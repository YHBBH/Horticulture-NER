A survey for the detection of [@cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*]-W ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), [$squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [$melon#Plant*] necrotic spot virus ([$MNSV#Virus*]), [$cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) and [$watermelon mosaic virus-2#Virus*] ([$WMV-2#Virus*]) was carried out in June and July 2005, covering 17 [$melon#Plant*] fields and 19 [$watermelon#Plant*] fields in the Tekirdag, Edirne and Kirklareli provinces of Turkish Thrace.
Among all the fields sampled, only one [$melon#Plant*] field was not virus-infected.
In all, 502 [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] samples were tested for the presence of seven viruses with [@ELISA tests using polyclonal antisera#Method*].
Overall, 333 out of 502 samples tested positive for the investigated viruses: 167 out of 235 plant samples in Tekirdag, 103 out of 187 samples in Edirne, and 63 out of 80 samples in Kirklareli were positive.
[$Serological tests#Method*] showed that six out of the seven tested viruses were present in the Thrace region of Turkey.
The following rates of incidence of tested viruses on [$watermelon#Plant*] were found: [$ZYMV#Virus*] (45.5%), [$WMV-2#Virus*] (34.2%), [$CMV#Virus*] (19.9%), [$PRSV-W#Virus*] (2.1%), [$SqMV#Virus*] (1.8%) and [$MNSV#Virus*] (0.4%), while the rates of incidence on [$melon#Plant*] were [$ZYMV#Virus*] (40.3%), [$WMV-2#Virus*] (31.2%), [$CMV#Virus*] (7.2%), [$PRSV-W#Virus*] (2.3%), [$SqMV#Virus*] (0.5%) and [$MNSV#Virus*] (1.8%).
The [$WMV-2#Virus*]+[$ZYMV#Virus*] mixed infection type was the most widespread both on [$melon#Plant*] and on [$watermelon#Plant*] samples at 16.7% and 11.4%, respectively.
