A study was conducted to evaluate the use of reflective mulch and host plant resistance for the management of the [@sweetpotato#Plant*] [$whitefly#Virus*], [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] ([@Gennadius#Virus*]) ([@Hemiptera#Virus*]: [@Aleyrodidae#Virus*]), in [$watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*] (Thunberg) Matsum & Nakai].
Whitefly abundance data were collected under both greenhouse (caged and uncaged) and field conditions.
Consistently, a reflective mulch (also called silver or metallic) treatment resulted in a lower incidence of adult [$whiteflies#Virus*] as compared with a standard black mulch treatment.
Moreover, two [$whitefly#Virus*] resistant [$Citrullus colocynthis (L)#Plant*] Schrad genotypes, which are wild relatives of cultivated [$watermelon#Plant*], reduced [$whitefly#Virus*] populations as compared with standard [$watermelon#Plant*].
There was generally no interaction between the mulch and genotype variables.
No effect of mulch color was observed on sticky card capture of Delphastus catalinae (Horn), a [$whitefly#Virus*] predator, or on capture of an Eretmocerus sp.
[$whitefly#Virus*] parasitoid in caged trials, which suggests no adverse effect on these natural enemies when using reflective mulch.
Overall [$whitefly#Virus*] populations were relatively low during four seasons of field trials (2006-2009).
Results from this study suggest that a combination of using reflective mulch and host plant resistance can additively suppress [$whitefly#Virus*] infestations, which have particular importance in the fast-growing organic [$vegetable#Plant*] production industry.
