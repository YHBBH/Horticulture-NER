[@Symptoms of interveinal chlorosis (yellowing) #Disease*]are commonly observed in [@melon#Plant*] or [$cucumber plants#Plant*] grown in greenhouses in the southeastern coast of Spain.
The agent of the disease was determined to be [@cucurbit yellow stunting disorder Virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]).
[$CYSDV#Virus*] was shown to be transmitted specifically by the [$tobacco#Plant*] [$whitefly#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]), was retained by the vector for at least 7 days.
and had an experimental host range restricted to members of the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
[@Filamentous, flexuous virus#Virus*] particles typical of the closteroviruses were observed in infected plants.
The length distribution of the virus particles showed two [$pea#Plant*]ks at 825 to 850 nm and 875 to 900 nm.
Analysis oi double-stranded (ds) RNA extracts revealed two major dsRNA species of approximately 8 and 9 kbp, Random cDNA cloning of viral dsRNA was performed, and a virus-specific cDNA clone (p410) of 557 nucleotides that hybridized with the smaller of the two viral dsRNA species was identified.
[$Computer-assisted analysis#Method*] showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of p410 was significantly similar to the [$HSP70#Gene*] homologs of the closteroviruses and showed greater similarity to the [$HSP70#Gene*] homolog of the BI tabaci-transmitted [$lettuce#Plant*] infectious yellows closterovirus ([$LIYV#Virus*]) than to the [$HSP70#Gene*] homologs oi the aphid-transmitted closteroviruses.
The data suggest that [$CYSDV#Virus*] is a member of a newly recognized subgroup of closteroviruses with bipartite genomes exemplified by [$LIYV#Virus*].
