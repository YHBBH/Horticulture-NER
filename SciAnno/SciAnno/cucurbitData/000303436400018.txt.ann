Initium (common name = ametoctradin) is a new fungicidal active ingredient developed by BASF.
The innovative compound belongs to a new chemical class, the triazolo-pyrimidylamines.
Initium controls all major [$oomycete pathogens#Virus*], e.
g., [$Plasmopara viticola#Virus*] in [$grapes#Plant*], [$Phytophthora#Virus*] infestans in [$potatoes#Plant*] and[$ tomatoes#Plant*], and [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Initium is a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor interfering with the complex III (complex bc1) in the electron transport chain of the [$pathogen#Virus*], thus ATP synthesis in the fungal cells is inhibited.
Research has demonstrated that Initium does not show cross-resistance to fungicide classes such as Qo inhibitors, phenylamides, and carboxylic acid amides.
Initium is highly effective in inhibition of zoospore formation and release, zoosporangia release, motility, and germination.
At low concentrations Initium leads to bursting of zoospores within a few seconds.
Initium is a non-systemic fungicide that remains primarily on the leaf surface where it is adsorbed with high affinity to the epicuticular wax layer of the epidermis, and thus forms a stable protective film against fungal attack.
To ensure sustainable use and to complement fungicidal properties, Initium is marketed in ready formulations with other compounds of different mode of action such as dimethomorph.
In numerous field trials carried out worldwide, Initium applied either alone or in mixture with dimethomorph has been shown to be highly selective in a wide range of [$specialty crops#Plant*] and provides excellent oomycete control.
Initium has an excellent toxicological and ecotoxicological profile and is highly suitable for use in integrated [$crop#Plant*] management systems.
