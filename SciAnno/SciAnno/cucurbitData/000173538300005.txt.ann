The complete nucleotide sequence of the [@Zucchini green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@ZGMMV#Virus*]), a new member of the genus [$Tobamovirus#Virus*], has been determined.
The genome of [$ZGMMV#Virus*] is 6,513 nucleotides Iona and contains four open reading frames coding for proteins of 131, 189, 28, and 17 kDa from the 5' to 3' end, respectively.
The 5'- and 3'-nontranslated regions consist of 59 and 163 residues, respectively.
The sequences of the viral proteins exhibit high identity to the proteins of the members of the genus [$Tobamovirus#Virus*] and are distinct from other viruses within the subgroup of [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [@tobamoviruses#Virus*].
Results from [$phylogenetic tree#Method*]s of the coding regions demonstrated that [$ZGMMV#Virus*] is a very close relative of [$Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] and [$Cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] and is less similar to [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*].
Full-length cDNA of [$ZGMMV#Virus*] was directly amplified by [@reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) using the 5'-end primer containing a T7 RNA promoter sequence and 3'-end primer.
Capped in vitro transcript from the [$RT-PCR#Method*] products was infectious on [$zucchini squash#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [@Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] plants.
This cell-free system to produce infectious transcripts from uncloned cDNA copies is useful for quick assessment of infectivity of transcripts from plant RNA viruses prior to cloning.
Synthesized capped transcript from a full-length cDNA clone of the virus was highly infectious.
Progeny virus derived from infectious transcripts had the same biological and biochemical properties as wild-type virus.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a biologically active transcript from a [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [@tobamovirus#Virus*].
