Basic cytogenetic investigation of economically important members of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae is a prerequisite to understand their genetic architecture.
The study reports detailed [@chromosome morphometric analyses with fluorescence banding technique#Method*], differential distribution of heterochromatin, flow cytometric nuclear DNA contents and meiotic behavior of the native populations of [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*], [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] and [$Trichosanthes dioica#Plant*] in India.
In spite of frequent vegetative propagation, different populations of these cultivated [$cucurbits#Plant*] show regular genetic processes evident from stable chromosome counts, nuclear DNA sizes, ploidy levels and regular meiotic behavior.
Distal CMA(+ve) signals have been scored in two pairs of chromosomes in B.hispida and four pairs of chromosomes in [$L.cylindrica#Plant*], representing the GC rich heterochromatic portions in genomes.
The presence of terminal DAPI(+ve) bands in the chromosomes of male and female populations of T.dioica indicates the predominance of AT rich heterochromatin.
In addition to DAPI bands, terminal CMA(+ve) bands in the [$female plants#Plant*] of [@T.dioica#Plant*] depict the chromosomal signs of sexual differentiation in this species.
The existence of rod bivalent in meiosis of [$male plants#Plant*] facilitates further approach to characterize the genetics of chromosomal evolution since gross similarity in genome size and karyotypic features of male and [$female plants#Plant*] advocates genic control of sexual dimorphism in [$T.dioica#Plant*].
