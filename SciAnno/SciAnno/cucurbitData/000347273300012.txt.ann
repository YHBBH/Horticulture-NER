Although it is known that ethylene has a masculinizing effect on watermelon, the specific role of this hormone in sex expression and flower development has not been analyzed in depth.
By using different approaches the present work demonstrates that ethylene regulates differentially two sex-related developmental processes: sexual expression, i.e.
the earliness and the number of female flowers per plant, and the development of individual floral buds.
Ethylene production in the shoot apex as well as in male, female and bisexual flowers demonstrated that the female flower requires much more ethylene than the male one to develop, and that bisexual flowers result from a decrease in ethylene production in the female floral bud.
The occurrence of bisexual flowers was found to be associated with elevated temperatures in the greenhouse, concomitantly with a reduction of ethylene production in the shoot apex.
External treatments with ethephon and AVG, and the use of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstocks with different ethylene production and sensitivity, confirmed that, as occurs in other [$cucurbit species#Plant*], ethylene is required to arrest the development of stamens in the female flower.
Nevertheless, in [$watermelon#Plant*] ethylene inhibits the transition from male to female flowering and reduces the number of pistillate flowers per plant, which runs contrary to findings in other [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
The use of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstocks with elevated ethylene production delayed the production of female flowers but reduced the number of bisexual flowers, which is associated with a reduced fruit set and altered fruit shape.
