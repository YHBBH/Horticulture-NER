We employed degenerate primers to amplify nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain of resistance gene candidates (RGCs) from [@Tomato Leaf Curl New Delhi Virus#Virus*] ([$ToLCNDV#Virus*]) resistant [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] ([$sponge gourd#Plant*]) genotype, DSG-6.
Sixteen non-redundant sequences of RGCs were identified with un-interrupted open reading frames (ORFs) and high amino acid sequence homologies (60-98%) to various nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins from GenBank database.
Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of the NBS domain revealed six and ten [$sponge gourd#Plant*] (sg) RGCs belong to the Toll Interleukin Receptor (TIR) and non-TIR group of NBS-LRR genes, respectively.
The sgRGCs consisted of conserved NB-ARC [homologous region shared with APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1), R proteins and CED-4 (Caenorhabditis elegans death-4 protein)] domain from P-loop nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) family and characteristic P-loop, Kinase-2, RNBS-A, Kinase-3A and GLPL motifs.
The comparative analysis of expression profiles of sgRGCs in asymptomatic and field-driven symptomatic leaf tissues of [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] resistant and susceptible genotypes revealed RGCLc28 is expressed consistently in resistant genotypes.
The differentially expressed RGCLc28 of DSG-6 is predicted to have strong association with the resistance trait against the leaf curl and mosaic disease in [$sponge gourd#Plant*] and may serve as important genomic resource for candidate gene discovery.
