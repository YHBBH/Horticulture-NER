Epidemics of [@tomato yellow leaf curl disease#Disease*] ([@TYLCD#Disease*]) in the Dominican Republic in the early to mid-1990s resulted in catastrophic losses to processing [$tomato#Plant*] production.
As part of an integrated management approach to [$TYLCD#Disease*], the complete nucleotide sequence of a full-length infectious clone of an isolate of [@Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([@TYLCV#Virus*]) from the Dominican Republic ([$TYLCV#Virus*]-[DO]) was determined.
The [$TYLCV#Virus*]-[DO] genome was nearly identical in sequence (>97%) and genome organization to [$TYLCV#Virus*] isolates from Israel and Cuba.
This established that [$TYLCV#Virus*]-[DO] is a bonafide [$TYLCV#Virus*] isolate (rather than a recombinant virus, such as isolates from Israel [Mild], Portugal, Japan, and Iran), and provided further evidence for the introduction of the virus from the eastern Mediterranean.
A reduction in the incidence of [$TYLCV#Virus*] in the northern and southern processing [$tomato#Plant*] production areas of the Dominican Republic has been associated with the implementation of a mandatory 3-month [$whitefly#Virus*] host-free period (including [$tomato#Plant*], [@common bean#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], [@eggplant#Plant*], and [$pepper#Plant*]), Monitoring [$TYLCV#Virus*] levels in whiteflies, by [@polymerase chain reaction with TYLCV-specific primers#Method*], established that the incidence of [$TYLCV#Virus*] decreased markedly during the host-free period, and then gradually increased during the [$tomato#Plant*]-growing season.
In contrast, [$TYLCV#Virus*] persisted in whiteflies and [$tomato#Plant*] plants in an area in which the host-free period was not implemented.
Surveys for [$TYLCV#Virus*] reservoir hosts, conducted to identify where [$TYLCV#Virus*] persists during the host-free period, revealed symptomless infections in a number of [$weed#Plant*] species.
The implications of these findings for [$TYLCV#Virus*] management in the Dominican Republic are discussed.
