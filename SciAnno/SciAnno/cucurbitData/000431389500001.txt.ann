The structure and temporal dynamics of the virulence of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] (causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*]) were studied in [$pathogen#Virus*] populations in the Czech Republic from 2001 to 2010.
A total of 398 [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates collected from [@Cucumis (Cm.) sativus#Plant*], [@Cm.melo#Plant*], [@Cucurbita (Cr.) maxima#Plant*], [@Cr.pepo#Plant*], [@Cr.moschata#Plant*] and [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] were analysed for variation in virulence (pathotypes).
Virulence was evaluated on a differential set of 12 genotypes of [$cucurbitaceous#Plant*] plants.
All isolates of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]were characterized by their level of virulence (classified according the number of virulence factors, VF; low VF = 1-4, medium VF = 5-8, high VF = 9-12): high (75%), medium (24%) and low (1%).
The structure and dynamics of virulence in the [$pathogen#Virus*] populations were expressed by pathotypes using tetrad numerical codes and a total of 67 different pathotypes of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]were determined.
The most susceptible group of differentials was [$Cucumis spp.#Plant*], while the lowest frequency of virulence was recorded on [@Cr.pepo ssp.pepo#Plant*], [@Ci.lanatus#Plant*] and [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*].
A high proportion (c.90%) of isolates was able to infect [$cucurbit species #Plant*][$Benincasa hispida#Plant*] and [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*], which are not commonly cultivated in the Czech Republic or elsewhere in central Europe.
In the recent [$pathogen#Virus*] populations (2008-2010) there was prevailing frequency (70-100%) of isolates with high numbers (9-12) of virulence factors.
'Super pathotype' 15.15.15 was often observed in the study within the [$pathogen#Virus*] populations and was one of the four most frequently recorded pathotypes.
[$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*] populations shifted to a higher virulence over time.
From 2009 the [$pathogen#Virus*] population changed dramatically and new pathotypes appeared able to establish natural and serious infection of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] spp.and [$Ci.lanatus#Plant*], which was not observed in 2001-2008.
Generally, virulence structure and dynamics of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations are extremely variable in the Czech Republic.
