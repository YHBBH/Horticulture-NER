 A set of 155 [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] cultivars and newly-bred lines from Europe and the United States was studied under controlled conditions for resistance to one isolate of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] ([@Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk.and Curt.Rostow.#Virus*]) originating from [$cucumbers#Plant*].
 The cultivars tested showed no resistance to [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
 There were only a few cultivars (e.g.Anuschka F1, Nora F1, Minerva F1) that exhibited reduced sporulation.
 This phenomenon is discussed in relation to the expression of field resistance in [$C.sativus#Plant*].
