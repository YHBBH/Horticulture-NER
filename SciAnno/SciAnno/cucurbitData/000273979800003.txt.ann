We developed [@polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays#Method*] to detect and quantify Phomopsis sclerotioides, the causal agent of [$black root rot#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
We used internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from representative isolates to search for target sequences.
Primer pairs were selected after testing against 40 fungal isolates including 13 Ph.
sclerotioides isolates, 9 Phomopsis isolates other than Ph.
sclerotioides, and 18 soilborne fungi that were either pathogenic or non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic to [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Conventional [$PCR assays#Method*] with the primer pair of [$CP#Gene*]s-1 (forward) and [$CP#Gene*]s-2 (reverse) produced target DNA amplicons from all Ph.
sclerotioides isolates but none of the other isolates tested.
From soil and root samples collected from fields naturally infested with [$black root rot#Disease*] of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*], the [$CP#Gene*]s-1/[$CP#Gene*]s-2 primer pair successfully amplified target DNA fragments in conventional [$PCR assays#Method*].
Moreover, we applied the [$CP#Gene*]s-1/[$CP#Gene*]s-2 primer pair in a [$real-time PCR#Method*] assay with SYBR Green I, and [$PCR#Method*]-amplified products were successfully quantified by reference to a standard curve generated by adding known amounts of target DNA.
Target Ph.
sclerotioides DNA fragments were similarly detected in artificially inoculated roots of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*], but quantities of Ph.
sclerotioides DNA in their hypocotyls of the hosts varied as follows: [$melon#Plant*] a parts per thousand yen [$cucumber#Plant*] a parts per thousand yen [$watermelon#Plant*] > [$pumpkin#Plant*].
These results suggest that Ph.
sclerotioides infection is not species-specific but the rate of infection may differ among host species.
