The [@downy mildew pathogen#Virus*], [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], which [@infe#Virus*]cts plant species in the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], has undergone major changes during the last decade.
Disease severity and epidemics are far more destructive than previously reported, and new genotypes, races, pathotypes, and mating types of the [$pathogen#Virus*] have been discovered in populations from around the globe as a result of the resurgence of the disease.
Consequently, disease control through host plant resistance and fungicide applications has become more complex.
This resurgence of P.
cubensis offers challenges to scientists in many research areas including pathogen biology, [$epidemiology#Method*] and dispersal, population structure and population genetics, host preference, host-[$pathogen#Virus*] interactions and gene expression, genetic host plant resistance, inheritance of host and fungicide resistance, and chemical disease control.
This review serves to summarize the current status of this major [$pathogen#Virus*] and to guide future management and research efforts within this pathosystem.
