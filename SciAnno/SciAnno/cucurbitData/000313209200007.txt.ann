[@Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) ([@genus Ipomovirus#Virus*], [$family Potyviridae#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) ([$genus Crinivirus#Virus*], [$family Closteroviridae#Virus*]) are included in the EPPO A2 Action List of [$pathogens#Virus*] and have become a limiting factor of [$cucumber#Plant*] production in the southeast of Spain.
Due to the importance of these two [$pathogens#Virus*] and the need to have robust tools that can be used in risk assessment procedures to predict future epidemics, a [@real-time RT-PCR method based on TaqMan(R) chemistry#Method*] has been developed.
This method is fast, sensitive, specific and easy to automate in plant health laboratories.
