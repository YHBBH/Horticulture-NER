Fifty-eight cultivars of[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] (mostly [$zucchini#Plant*] type) were studied in three-year experiments for field resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] caused by [$Erysiphe cichoracearum#Virus*].
No genotypes were found with complete resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
There were significant differences in the expression of field resistance characterized by some basic epidemiological parameters (maximum infection degree, area below curve).
The highest level of field resistance occurred in 13 cultivars including Acceste F1, Albina, Ambassador F1, CU-235, Elite F1, Goldfinger, Parmanta F1, Seneca Hybr.
F1.
