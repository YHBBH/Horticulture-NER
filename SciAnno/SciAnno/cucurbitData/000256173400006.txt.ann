The flowering pattern of [@watermelon#Plant*] species ([@Citrullus spp.#Plant*]) is either monoecious or andromonoecious.
Ethylene is known to play a critical role in floral sex determination of [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
In contrast to its feminizing effect in [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*], in [$watermelon#Plant*] ethylene promotes male flower development.
In [$cucumber#Plant*], the rate-limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase ([@ACS#Gene*]), regulates unisexual flower development.
To investigate the role of ethylene in flower development, we isolated four genomic sequences of [$ACS#Gene*] from [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@CitACS1-4#Gene*]).
Both [@CitACS1#Gene*] and [@CitACS3#Gene*] are expressed in floral tissue.
[$CitACS1#Gene*] is also expressed in vegetative tissue and it may be involved in cell growth processes.
Expression of [$CitACS1#Gene*] is up-regulated by exogenous treatment with auxin, gibberellin or ACC, the immediate precursor of ethylene.
No discernible differential floral sex-dependent expression pattern was observed for this gene.
The [$CitACS3#Gene*] gene is expressed in open flowers and in young staminate floral buds (male or hermaphrodite), but not in female flowers.
[$CitACS3#Gene*] is also up-regulated by ACC, and is likely to be involved in ethylene-regulated anther development.
The expression of Cit[$ACS#Gene*]2 was not detected in vegetative or reproductive organs but was up-regulated by auxin.
Cit[$ACS#Gene*]4 transcript was not detected under our experimental conditions.
[@Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence tagged site (STS) marker analyses#Method*] of the [@CitACS#Gene*] genes showed polymorphism among and within the different [@Citrullus groups#Plant*], including [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars, [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] var.lanatus, the central subspecies [@Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*], and the desert species [@Citrullus colocynthis (L)#Plant*].
