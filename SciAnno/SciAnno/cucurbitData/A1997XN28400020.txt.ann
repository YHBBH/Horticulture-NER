[@Melon rugose mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@MRMV#Virus*]) was isolated from [$snake cucumber#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo var.flexuosus#Plant*]) in the Kassala region of Sudan in 1993.
The host range of the virus was mostly limited to [$cucurbits#Plant*], where it induced severe mosaic and leaf deformations.
[@Cytopathological studies#Method*] revealed severe chloroplast alterations, including vesicles at their periphery and the tendency to aggregate, which are typical of [$tymovirus#Virus*] infections, providing further evidence that [$MRMV#Virus*] is a tentative member of the [@genus Tymovirus#Virus*].
In [$melon#Plant*] and [$snake cucumber#Plant*], [$MRMV#Virus*] was found to be seed transmitted at rates of 0.9 and 3.8%, respectively.
Seed dissection experiments revealed that the virus could be detected in the seed coat, papery layer, and embryo.
Seed disinfection treatments did not reduce seed transmission rates, which suggests an internal transmission.
A preliminary screening for resistance in [$melon#Plant*] revealed some resistance in two out of 367 accessions tested.
