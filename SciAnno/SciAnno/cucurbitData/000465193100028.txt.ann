The response of two [$Citrullus amarus#Plant*] accessions, BGV0005164 and BGV0005167, was assessed against different [@Meloidogyne arenaria#Virus*], [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*], and [$Meloidogyne javanica#Plant*] isolates in pot experiments and against [$M.incognita#Virus*] in plastic greenhouse.
In the pot experiments, plants were inoculated with a second-stage juvenile per cm(3) of sterile sand and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 degrees C for 50 days.
The [@watermelon cv.Sugar Baby#Plant*] was included as a susceptible control for comparison.
At the end of the experiments, the number of egg masses and eggs per plant was determined, and the reproduction index was calculated as the percentage of the number of eggs produced in the [$C.amarus#Plant*] accessions with regard to that produced in the susceptible cv.Sugar Baby.
In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the ungrafted [$watermelon cv.Sugar Baby#Plant*] and [$watermelons#Plant*] grafted onto each of the [$C.amarus#Plant*] accessions and onto the [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstock cv.
Robusta were cultivated from May to August 2016 in plots with nematode densities from 46 to 1392 J2 per 250 cm(3) of soil at transplantation.
At the end of the experiment, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant were determined, and the reproduction index was calculated.
Additionally, the compatibility of the two accessions with the [$watermelon cv.Sugar Baby#Plant*] and the effect on fruit quality (weight, size, shape, firmness, pH, total soluble solids, and flesh color) were assessed under a hydroponic system in a greenhouse.
The commercial rootstocks cv.Cobalt and cv.Robusta were also included.
All the Meloidogyne isolates produced less egg masses and eggs per plant on the accessions than on Sugar Baby.
Both accessions performed as resistant against [$M.arenaria#Virus*], and from highly to moderately resistant to [$M.incognita#Virus*] and [$M.javanica#Virus*] in pot experiments.
In the plastic greenhouse experiment, both [$C.amarus#Plant*] accessions performed as resistant to [$M.incognita#Virus*].
Both [$C.amarus#Plant*] accessions were compatible with the [$watermelon cv.Sugar Baby#Plant*], but only the BGV0005167 accession did not influence the fruit quality.
Then, the BGV0005167 accession is a promising rootstock for managing the three tropical [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] species without influencing [$watermelon#Plant*] fruit quality.
