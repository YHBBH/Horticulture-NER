[@Cucurbit species#Plant*] grown in the Vojvodina Province, Serbia, were surveyed for the incidence of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) and [$Tobacco ringspot viru#Virus*]s ([$TRSV#Virus*]) from 2007 to 2009.
Samples from more than 700 [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$squash #Plant*]and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] plants with virus-like symptoms were analyzed by [@double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA#Method*].
[$ZYMV#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*] and [$CMV#Virus*] were detected in 79.2, 32.2, and 12.8% of tested samples, respectively.
[$WMV#Virus*] was prevalent in 2007 and [$ZYMV#Virus*] in 2008-09.
Mixed infections were the most frequent type in 2007-08 in contrast to 2009 when single infection of [$ZYMV#Virus*] prevailed.
[$ZYMV#Virus*] was the most widespread being found in 33 out of 39 inspected fields.
[$Virus#Virus*] species identification was confirmed in selected samples by conventional [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) and sequencing of their [$coat protein gene#Gene*]s.
By comparing the obtained virus isolate sequences with those available in GenBank, the identification of serologically detected viruses was confirmed.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] based on complete [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) sequences highlighted that Serbian [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates were closely related to other Central European [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates.
Finally, additional testing of [$ELISA#Method*]-negative samples by [@RT-PCR using primers specific#Method*] to six other mosaic viruses revealed the presence of [$Tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$TSWV#Virus*]) in winter ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]) and summer (C.
pepo 'Beogradska') [$squash#Plant*].
This is the first report of [$TSWV#Virus*] natural occurrence on [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Serbia and on [$winter squash#Plant*] worldwide.
