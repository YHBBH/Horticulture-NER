 Fruit setting and development in a monoecious [$cucurbit#Virus*], [$Momordica charantia L#Plant*].
could be regulated by the external application of gibberellin (GA3) and ethrel.
Both GA3 and ethrel in lower concentrations promoted female flower production as well as fruit setting and development.
Both growth regulators improved the quality of the [$Momordica#Plant*] fruit by increasing length, breath and biomass of the fruits as well as by increasing the content of total sugar of the fruit.
