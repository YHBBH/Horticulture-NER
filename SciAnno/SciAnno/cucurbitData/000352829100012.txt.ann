This study was performed to analyze genetic relationships of the four major [@cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*] including [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [$squash#Plant*]/[$pumpkin#Plant*].
Among 120 EST-SSR primer sets selected from the International [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Initiative (ICuGI) database, [$PCR#Method*] was successful for 51 (49.17%) primer sets and 49 (40.8%) primer sets showed polymorphisms among eight[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae acces[$sions#Plant*].
A total of 382 allele-specific [$PCR#Method*] bands were produced by 49 EST-SSR primers from 24 [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] accessions and used for analysis of pairwise similarity and dendrogram construction.
Assessment of the genetic relationships resulted in similarity indexes ranging from 0.01 to 0.85.
In the dendrogram, 24 [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] accessions were classified into two major groups (Clade I and II) and 8 subgroups.
Clade I comprised two subgroups, Clade I-1 for [$watermelon#Plant*] accessions [I-la and I-1b-2: three wild-type [$watermelons#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] Mats.& Nakai), I-1b-1: six [@watermelon cultivars#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] var.
vulgaris Schrad.)] and Clade 1-2 for [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] acces[$sions#Plant*] [1-2a-1: 4 [$melon cultivars#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo var.cantalupensis Naudin.#Plant*]), I-2a-2: oriental [$melon cultivars#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*] var.conomon Makino.), and I-2b: five [@cucumber cultivars#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*])].
[$Squash#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*] accessions composed Clade II {II-1: two [$squash#Plant*]/ [$pumpkin#Plant*] cultivars [[$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] (Duch.ex Lam.)/Duch.& Poir.and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima Duch.] and II-2: two [$squash#Plant*]/[$pumpkin#Plant*] cultivars,[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] L./[$Cucurbita ficifolia Bouch#Plant*]e.).
These results were in accordance with previously reported classification of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae species, indicating that [$watermelon#Plant*] EST-SSRs show a high level of marker transferability and should be useful for genetic study in other [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
