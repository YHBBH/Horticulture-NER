Molecular genetic polymorphisms within [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] isolates of different geographic origins were investigated to establish their phylogenetic relationships and to assess genetic variability between two distant [$pathogen#Virus*] Populations.
Thirty isolates originating front Greece (Crete; 15), the Czech Republic (13), the Netherlands (one) and France (one) were analysed by [@AFLP fingerprinting and ITS 5.8S rDNA sequence analysis#Method*].
All isolates were obtained from [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) plants showing typical [$downy mildew#Virus*] symptoms.
Four [@AFLP primer#Method*] combinations produced a total of 288 high-quality bands of which 45% were polymorphic, allowing isolates to be grouped into two separate Clusters: one including the Central European (Czech Republic) and Western European (the Netherlands and France) and the other the Cretan isolates.
Within each [$AFLP#Method*] Cluster there was sonic variation, which could be accounted for by geographic origin or [$pathogenicity#Plant*].
The two populations (Cretan vs.Central and Western Euroean) exhibited a high degree of genetic isolation.
There was no clear [$AFLP#Method*] grouping of isolates oil the basis of pathotypes.
No variability was detected in the I region; however, ITS2 sequences grouped [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates ill two subclusters one with all investigated European and the other with Asian isolates.
The two subclusters formed a larger [$P.cubensis #Virus*]Cluster which was differentiated from the cluster of the neighbouring species [$Pseudoperonospora#Virus*] humuli.
Within [$P.cubensis#Virus*], [$AFLP#Method*] fingerprints could resolve genetically isolated populations, even oil small or medium geographic scales, while ITS2 sequence showed differences oil a global scale, being only suitable for [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*].
