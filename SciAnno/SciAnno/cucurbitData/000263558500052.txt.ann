There is no [@cucurbit cultivar#Plant*] with measurable resistance against [@Phytophthora blight#Disease*], caused by [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*], available.
Genetic complexity of sources of [$Phytophthora#Virus*] resistance and variation in genetics of [@P.capsici#Virus*] are the serious challenge in breeding for resistance to [$Phytophthora blight#Disease*].
At present, Cultural practices and chemical use are the options for managing [$Phytophthora blight#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
The most effective strategy for controlling [$P.capsici#Virus*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*] was an integrated approach of [$crop#Plant*] rotation for >= 3 years, seed treatment with mefenoxam (0.42 ml Apron XL LS/kg of seed), avoiding the use of contaminated water with [$P.capsici#Virus*], and [$fungicide#Method*] spray-applications.
Among more than 50 fungicides tested, only dimethomorph (Acrobat, Forum), famoxadone-cymoxanil (Tanos), cyazofamid (Ranman), zoxamide-mancozeb (Gavel), mandipropamid (Ravus), and captan were found effective for control of [$P.capsici#Virus*].
