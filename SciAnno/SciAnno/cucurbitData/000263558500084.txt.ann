Drought stress is a major environmental factor influencing plant growth and development.
[@Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*] is a very drought tolerant [@cucurbit species#Plant*] with a deep root system.
Differences in gene expression during drought were studied [@using cDNA-AFLP#Method*].
In this study, we focus on mRNA accumulation of drought-induced genes in [@C.colocynthis#Plant*] treated with PEG, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) or NaCl.
Two genes, [@CcrbohD#Gene*] and [@CcrbohF#Gene*], encoding respiratory burst oxidase proteins were cloned [@using RACE#Method*].
Sequence comparison showed that the [$CcrbohD#Gene*] protein has a conserved region at the N terminus with an EF-hand loop domain, characteristic of the RBO protein family.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] confirmed that [$CcrbohD#Gene*] and [$CcrbohF#Gene*] belong to the RBOHD and RBOHF subfamily, which play an important role in response to stress Stimuli.
[$Real-time RT-PCR#Method*] analysis showed that expression of [$CcrbohD#Gene*] was rapidly and strongly induced by abiotic stress imposed by PEG, ABA, SA, and JA treatment.
Our data Suggest that [$CcrbohD#Gene*] holds great promise for improving drought tolerance of other [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
