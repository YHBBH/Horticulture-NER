[@Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) is the first-known [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$tobamovirus#Virus*].
To analyse its biological and molecular diversities, 36 isolates of [$CGMMV#Virus*] were collected from [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus vulgaris#Plant*]) and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) plants in Korea.
The cDNAs of [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) and partial movement protein genes of the isolates were synthesized by reverse transcription and [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) and subjected to [@single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis#Method*] with 530 bp-synthesized [$RT-PCR#Method*] products.
[$CGMMV#Virus*] isolates were categorized into three subgroups by [@SSCP analysis#Method*], designated types I, II and III.
All [$watermelon#Plant*] isolates of [$CGMMV#Virus*] belonged to types I and II, whereas [$cucumber#Plant*] isolates were subgrouped into types II and III.
These three type isolates of [$CGMMV#Virus*] were divided by [@RT-PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using full-length cDNAs#Method*] of three types of [$CGMMV#Virus*].
Biological properties of each subgroup-type of [$CGMMV#Virus*] isolates were determined by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*] of common [$host plants#Plant*] of [$CGMMV#Virus*].
Among the virus isolates, isolate NW-1, belonging to type I, did not infect [$cucumber#Plant*] (cv.
Baegbong), whereas all [$CGMMV#Virus*] isolates (types II and III) infected the same host species.
In addition, all isolates of [$CGMMV#Virus*] types could infect [$Nicotiana#Plant*] debneyii, except that isolate KC1-2, subgrouped into type III, failed to infect.
Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of [$CP#Gene*] gene of [$CGMMV#Virus*] isolates were compared to those of reported [$CGMMV#Virus*]s and other [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$tobamoviruses#Virus*].
In [@phylogenetic tree analyses#Method*] between [$CGMMV#Virus*] isolates and other [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$tobamoviruses#Virus*], [$CGMMV#Virus*] was subgrouped as a cluster and no remarkable molecular diversity was found among the [$CGMMV#Virus*] isolates.
