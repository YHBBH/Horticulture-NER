[@Cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], caused by [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], is a major [$cucumber#Plant*] disease in the Czech Republic.
Disease prevalence, host range and disease severity were evaluated from 2001 to 2009.
The geographical distribution of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was assessed on ca 80-100 locations per year in two main regions of the Czech Republic (central and southern Moravia, and eastern, northern and central Bohemia).
Infection by [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was observed primarily on [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) but only on the leaves.
During the study, disease prevalence ranged from 66 to 100%.
The majority of [$C.sativus#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] were heavily infected at the end of the growing season (second half of August).
Generally, [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was present at high or very high disease severity.
The loss of foliage results in the reduction in the quality and quantity of marketable yield of fruit.
[$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] was widespread across the whole area of the Czech Republic studied.
Very rarely, infection was recorded in [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata.
Of other [$pathogens#Virus*], the most frequently recorded was the [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*] and [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*]).
