The development, characterization and application of [@cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) [$microsatellite markers#Method*] was accomplished [@using a library-enrichment procedure#Method*].
Fifty-seven primer pairs flanking the microsatellite re[$pea#Plant*]ts were used for DNA amplification.
Sixteen [$C.sativus#Plant*] accessions were assessed for polymorphisms [@using 45 primer pairs#Method*].
The average number of alleles per locus was 3.6, and up to seven alleles were found at one locus.
The maximum polymorphism information content value was 0.78 with an average of 0.47.
The [$cucumber#Plant*] microsatellite makers could be useful for seed purity control in hy[@bridity testing#Method*].
Some of these [$cucumber#Plant*] markers were transferable to other [$cucurbit species#Plant*] (i.e.
[$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$bitter gourd#Plant*]).
