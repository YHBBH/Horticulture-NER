In Venezuela, [@cucurbit#Plant*] viruses have been associated with important yield losses.
Therefore, an extensive survey was conducted to determine the major [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]in this country.
Leaf samples from 284 [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] exhibiting virus-like symptoms were collected mainly in 2009-2010 from several states of Venezuela.
They were assessed for viral infection by [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) for [@Melon chlorotic mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@MeCMV#Virus*]) and [@reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR#Method*] for [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]).
The most common virus in [$cucurbit #Plant*]fields, [$MeCMV#Virus*], was present in 658% of samples.
Its associated alphasatellite was found in 78% of samples positive for [$MeCMV#Virus*].
[$PRSV#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*] and [$WMV#Virus*] were found with different prevalence: 342, 324 and 11% respectively.
[$CMV#Virus*] was also detected (67%) but [$SqMV#Virus*] and [$CABYV#Virus*] were not found.
Single infections were more frequent than mixed infections (564 and 386%, respectively).
For [$ZYMV#Virus*], comparison and [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of either polymerase and [$coat protein#Gene*] ([@NIb-CP#Gene*]) partial sequences or [$CP#Gene*] complete sequences revealed a low genetic diversity within Venezuelan isolates.
Thirty-four [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates were used for serological and biological analysis.
Thirteen monoclonal antibodies showed a major group of isolates spread in several states and two groups located in Zulia only.
Venezuelan [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates showed biological variability on [$cucurbit cultivar#Plant*]s susceptible, tolerant or resistant to [$ZYMV#Virus*].
Resistance to [$ZYMV#Virus*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] ap[$pears#Plant*] potentially durable, whereas resistance or tolerance in [$zucchini#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] may be easily overcome.
