Sustainability is restorative towards nature.
Traditional crop diversity should be maintained, assessed and characterized for sustainable farming and food security.
Snake gourd (Trichosanthes anguina L.) is a minor monoecious cucurbit grown mainly on marginal lands in West Bengal with little inputs.
Considerable genetic diversity in snake gourd genotypes, both landraces and local cultivars, exists in this region.
Thirty one diverse genotypes collected from different growing areas of Bengal were evaluated for polymorphism on the basis of twelve morphological characters through multivariate analysis for estimation of genetic divergence using D-2 statistic during the spring-summer season of 2008-2009.
Based on the D-2 values between any two genotypes, a logical grouping of the genotypes with low D-2 values could be arrived at by Tocher's method.
The genotypes were grouped into six clusters with cluster 1 having the maximum number of genotypes (13) followed by cluster 2, ten genotypes; cluster 3 contained 5 and clusters 4, 5 and 6, one genotype each.
Such a clustering pattern indicates wide range of diversity among the genotypes.
The intra-cluster distance was low, indicating homogeneity in the genotypes in a particular cluster.
The maximum inter cluster divergence was recorded between cluster 1 and 5 (18.003).
On the basis of mean fruit yield and important economic characters, namely days to first female flower, days to first fruit set, days to first harvest, weight of fruit and number of fruits per plant, four genotypes namely, BCSG-6, BCSG-11, BCSG-36 and BCSG-38 could be selected for hybridization schemes, from which the resultant desirable segregates may further be selected in future breeding programmes.
