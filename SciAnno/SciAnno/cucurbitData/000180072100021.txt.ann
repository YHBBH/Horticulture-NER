[@Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([@MYSV#Virus*]) and [@Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] ([@WSMoV#Virus*]) are distinct virus species belonging to the genus [@Tospovirus#Virus*] in the [@Family Bunyaviridae#Virus*].
They have quasi-spherical virions with lipid envelopes where three single-stranded RNA segments are contained, and are persistently transmitted by Thrips palmi.
[$WSMoV#Virus*] was first identified in 1982, and it has been causing problems on [$watermelon#Plant*], [@wax gourd#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [@bitter gourd#Plant*] productions in Japan and Taiwan.
[$MYSV#Virus*] was first identified in 1992, and it has been causing severe damages on [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] productions in Japan.
Nucleotide sequences of the smallest RNA segments of [$WSMoV#Virus*] and [$MYSV#Virus*] were analyzed to examine genetic relationships.
Identities of the [@nucleocapsid protein#Gene*] genes of [$WSMoV#Virus*] or [$MYSV#Virus*] with other [@tospovirus#Virus*] species suggested that [$MYSV#Virus*] and Physalis [@severe mottle virus#Virus*] ([@PYSV#Virus*]) were considerably similar.
Identities of the [$nucleocapsid protein#Gene*] genes and the non-structural genes of two isolates of [$MYSV#Virus*] from [$cucumber#Plant*] plants with those of reported [$MYSV#Virus*] with those with PSMV were more than 96%.
Therefore, PSMV and [$MYSV#Virus*] should be classified as the same species.
Comparison of Japanese isolates and Taiwanese isolates of [$WSMoV#Virus*] suggested that they are genetically related each other, except for a 20 nucleotide insertion sequence was found in Japanese isolates.
[@RT-PCR assay#Method*] with specific primers of [$WSMoV#Virus*] or [$MYSV#Virus*] were examined.
[$RT-PCR#Method*] with [$WSMoV#Virus*] specific primers WN5 ((5') -GCACACACATAGGTAT[$AAC#Virus*]T-(3')) and WN3 ((5') -TCCTTTGTA[$AAC#Virus*]ACCATG-(3-)) detected approximately 1.1 kb DNA fragment from [$WSMoV#Virus*]-infected samples.
[$RT-PCR#Method*] with [$MYSV#Virus*] specific primers MN5 ((5') TATTTCATTC[$AAC#Virus*]TAGTTAA(3')) and MN3 ((5') ATTC[$AAC#Virus*]ATCAGCAAGTCAA(3')) detected approximately 1.0 kb DNA fragment only from [$MYSV#Virus*]-infected samples.
No significant amplification was detected from other [$tospovirus#Virus*] -infected samples or healthy samples.
