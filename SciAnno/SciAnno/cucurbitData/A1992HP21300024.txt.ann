Four strains of [@zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) from Connecticut (CT), Florida (FL), France (WK), and Taiwan (TW) were partially characterized and compared.
 Host ranges of the four strains were similar but they differed in the ability to [$infe#Plant*]ct specific hosts.
 All [$ZYMV#Virus*] strains were indistinguishable in [@SDS-immunodiffusion tests#Method*].
 After cross-absorption with antigens of [$ZYMV#Virus*]-CT and -FL, antiserum to [$ZYMV#Virus*]-TW reacted with [$ZYMV#Virus*]-TW but not with [$ZYMV#Virus*]-CT, -FL, or -WK in [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*]s.
 Serological comparisons revealed that [$ZYMV#Virus*] was related to [@watermelon mosaic 2#Virus*] ([$WMV-2#Virus*]), [@pea mosaic#Virus*] ([@PMV#Virus*]), [@bean common mosaic#Virus*] ([@BCMV#Virus*]), [@clover yellow vein#Virus*] ([@CYVV#Virus*]), and [@bean yellow mosaic (BYMV) viruses#Virus*].
 The relatedness of [$ZYMV#Virus*] to these viruses was shown only with antisera produced to the [$ZYMV#Virus*] strains and varied depending on the length of time after immunization that antisera was collected.
 Purified virus yields of the four strains of [$ZYMV#Virus*] ranged from 6 to 19 mg of virus per 100 g of infected tissue with a 260/280 nm absorbance ratio range of 1.22 to 1.27.
 Two [$aphid species#Virus*], [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] and [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*], transmitted [@ZYMV-CT#Virus*], [$ZYMV-FL#Virus*], and [@ZYMV-TW#Virus*] at different efficiencies but failed to transmit [$ZYMV-WK#Plant*].
