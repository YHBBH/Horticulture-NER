Sequence comparison had previously shown three amino acid changes in conserved motifs in the 455-amino acid sequence of the helper component-protease ([@HC-Pro#Gene*]) between a severe field strain of [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV-NAT#Virus*]) and a [$mild field strain of ZYMV#Virus*] ([@ZYMV-WK#Plant*]).
In this study, exchange of fragments and site-directed mutagenesis within the [@HC-Pro#Gene*] gene in an infectious clone of [$ZYMV#Virus*] enabled the effects of the mutations on symptom expression to be mapped.
The substitution of for Arg at position 180 in the conserved motif Phe-Arg-Asn-Lys (FRNK) of potyviruses was found to affect symptom expression.
Infection of [$cucurbits#Plant*] with the engineered [$ZYMV#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]-AG) that contained this mutation caused a dramatic symptom change from severe to mild in [$squash #Plant*]and to a symptom-free appearance in [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*].
The lie to Arg mutation was found to be stable, and no revertant virus was found after several passages through plants after long incubation periods.
The AG strain was detected 4 days postinoculation and accumulated in [$cucurbits#Plant*] to a level and with kinetics similar to that of the wild-type [$ZYMV#Virus*]-AT strain.
[$Cucurbit#Plant*] plants infected with the AG strain were protected against infection by the severe strain.
