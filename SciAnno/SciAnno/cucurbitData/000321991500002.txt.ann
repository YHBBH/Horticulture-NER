Seedlings of [@watermelon#Plant*] are susceptible to [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*], the [$cucurbit #Plant*][$pathogen#Virus*] that causes [$gummy stem blight#Disease*], particularly when they are grown in the greenhouse for use as transplants.
[$Seedlings #Plant*]of [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) and interspecific hybrid [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] x [$C.maxima#Plant*]) that are used as rootstocks for grafting [$watermelon#Plant*] are susceptible to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] when wounded.
Nonwounded rootstock [$seedlings#Plant*] of both genera were as susceptible to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] as seedless [$watermelon#Plant*].
Because grafted plants must be misted or held at high relative humidity for 1 week so the graft union will heal, fungicides may be necessary to manage [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] under these disease-conducive environmental conditions.
Nine fungicides were applied as foliar treatments at labeled rates per 467 liters/ha water to nongrafted [$seedlings#Plant*] of [$watermelon#Plant*] and five rootstock cultivars.
Fluopyram + tebuconazole injured all five [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and hybrid [$squash #Plant*]cultivars and stunted [$watermelon#Plant*] and hybrid [$squash #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*].
Cyprodinil + difenoconazole injured all five rootstock cultivars and [$watermelon#Plant*].
Tebuconazole stunted [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*].
Four of the five fungicides that were not phytotoxic reduced incidence and severity of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] on seedless [$watermelon#Plant*] grafted onto [$bottle gourd#Plant*] Emphasis and hybrid [$squash #Plant*]Strong Tosa.
Difenoconazole and cyprodinil were more effective than mancozeb or cyprodinil + fludioxonil, which were more effective than thiophanate-methyl, which was not significantly different from the water control (P = 0.01).
Nongrafted [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] and [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] grafted onto [$watermelon#Plant*] as the rootstock were as susceptible to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] as [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] grafted onto [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Although difenoconazole and cyprodinil are not registered currently on [$cucurbits#Plant*], transplant growers can apply mancozeb or cyprodinil + fludioxonil to manage [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] on [$watermelon#Plant*] and rootstock [$seedlings#Plant*] during greenhouse production.
