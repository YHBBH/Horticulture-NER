[@Cucurbit leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([@CuLCV#Virus*]), a [@whitefly-transmitted geminivirus#Virus*] previously partially characterized from the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, was identified as a distinct bipartite [@begomovirus#Virus*] species.
This virus has near sequence identity with the previously partially characterized [@Cucurbit leaf crumple virus#Virus*] from California.
Experimental and natural host range studies indicated that [$CuLCV#Virus*] has a relatively broad host range within the family [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] and also infects [@bean#Plant*] and [$tobacco#Plant*].
The genome of an Arizona isolate, designated [$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ, was cloned and completely sequenced.
Cloned [$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ DNA A and B components were infectious by biolistic inoculation to [$pumpkin#Plant*] and progeny virus was transmissible by the [$whitefly#Virus*] vector, [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*], thereby completing Koch's postulates.
[$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ DNA A shared highest nucleotide sequence identity with [@Squash leaf curl virus-R#Virus*] ([@SLCV-R#Virus*]), [@SLCV-E#Virus*], and [@Bean calico mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@BCaMV#Virus*]) at 84, 83, and 80%, respectively.
The [$CuLCV#Virus*] DNA B component shared highest nucleotide sequence identity with [$BCaMV#Virus*], [$SLCV-R#Virus*], and [@SLCV- E#Virus*] at 71, 70, and 68%, respectively.
The cis-acting [$begomovirus#Virus*] replication specificity element, GGTGTCCTGGTG, in the [$CuLCV#Virus*] AZ origin of replication is identical to that of [$SLCV-R#Virus*], [$SLCV-E#Virus*], and [$BCaMV#Virus*], suggesting that reassortants among components of [$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ and these [$begomovirus#Virus*]es may be possible.
[@Reassortment experiments#Method*] in [$pumpkin#Plant*] demonstrated that both reassortants of [$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ and [$SLCV-E#Virus*] A and B components were viable.
However, for [$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ and [$SLCV-R#Virus*], only one reassortant ([$SLCV-R#Virus*] DNA A/[$CuLCV#Virus*]-AZ DNA B) was viable on [$pumpkin#Plant*], even though the cognate component pairs of both viruses infect [$pumpkin#Plant*].
These results demonstrate that reassortment among sympatric [$begomovirus#Virus*] species infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] are possible, and that, if generated in nature, could result in [$begomovirus#Virus*]es bearing distinct biological properties.
