In the present work, the susceptibility of wild and domesticated plants of [@Momordica charantia#Plant*] to viruses from the [@genus Potyvirus#Virus*] that cause diseases in [$papaya#Plant*] ([$Carica papaya#Plant*]) and [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] was evaluated.
The plants were subjected to experimental and natural infection with [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] types P and W ([$PRSV-P#Virus*] and [$PRSV-W#Virus*]) and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
None of the [$potyviruses#Virus*] infected the wild type of [$M.charantia#Plant*] through mechanical or [$aphid#Virus*] inoculation or under field exposition, whereas the domesticated type was only infected by isolates of [$ZYMV#Virus*].
In addition, both wild and domesticated types of [$M.charantia#Plant*] were not infected in natural conditions by an isolate of [$Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus#Virus*], genus [$Tospovirus#Virus*], transmitted by [@Frankliniella zucchini#Virus*].
These data clearly indicated that this wild type of [$M.charantia#Plant*] does not seem to have a role in the epidemiology of the diseases caused by these three [$potyviruses#Virus*] in Brazil.
