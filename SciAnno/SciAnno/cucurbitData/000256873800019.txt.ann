[@Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]) is a recently described ipomovirus from [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Florida that induces the relatively unusual symptoms in [$watermelon#Plant*] of plant death and fruit rind necrosis and discoloration, commonly known in Florida as [@watermelon vine decline#Disease*].
In this report, [$SqVYV#Virus*] infection of [$Momordica charantia#Plant*] ([@Balsam-apple#Plant*]), a common [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$weed#Plant*], collected in 2005 and 2007 from within or adjacent to fields of declining [$watermelon#Plant*], is demonstrated through the use of nested [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]).
M.
charantia plants located in or around fallow [$watermelon#Plant*] fields between spring and fall 2007 [$watermelon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] were also infected with [$SqVYV#Virus*], indicating that this [$weed#Plant*] can serve as an oversummering host for this virus.
Furthermore, [$whiteflies#Virus*] were able to acquire [$SqVYV#Virus*] from infected [@M.charantia#Plant*] and transmit it to [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*].
Nested [$PCR#Method*] was 10 to 1,000 times more sensitive than non-nested [$PCR#Method*] for [$SqVYV#Virus*] detection in several [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts, including [$M.charantia#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*].
[$Melothria pendula#Plant*] (creeping [$cucumber#Plant*]), another common [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$weed#Plant*], was experimentally infected with [$SqVYV#Virus*].
These results suggest that improved management of [$M.charantia#Plant*] and other [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$weeds#Plant*] needs to be incorporated into [$watermelon vine decline#Method*] management plans to reduce sources of [$SqVYV#Virus*] and other [$cucurbit viruses#Virus*].
