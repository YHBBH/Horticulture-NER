The objective of this study was to measure honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) impact on seed set, fruit set, and yield of jack-o-lantern ([@Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]), large-sized ([@C.maxima Duch.#Plant*]), and processing [$pumpkins#Plant*] ([@C.moschata.Duch.ex Poir.#Plant*]) under field conditions.
There were sufficient natural pollinators [including bumblebees (Bombus spp.), carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.), honey bees, and squash bees (Peponapis pruinosa Say)] provided under field conditions to induce fruit set of jack-o-lantern [$pumpkins#Plant*] as fruit number obtained per hectare was not affected by the addition of a honey bee colony.
However, the addition of honey bees did increase fruit number per hectare of the [$C.moschata#Plant*] and [$C.maxima#Plant*] cultivars evaluated.
Money bee pollination resulted in larger-sized fruit, increasing individual fruit size of all but small-sized [$pumpkins#Plant*] (<0.5 kg).
Individual [$pumpkin#Plant*] fruit weights of the [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [$C.moschata#Plant*], and [$C.maxima#Plant*] cultivars evaluated increased by about, 26%, 70%, and 78%, respectively, when honey bee colonies were included.
Natural pollination was insufficient to stimulate maximum fruit size development and seed number and seed weight per fruit.
Although [$pumpkin#Plant*] fruit set will occur with natural pollinators, the addition of honey bee colonies will ensure the presence of pollinators to maximize fruit size.
Since [$pumpkins#Plant*] are generally sold on a weight basis, growers may generate greater revenues with the addition of honey bee colonies in [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields.
