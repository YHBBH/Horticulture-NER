The suitability of [@watermelon#Plant*] cultivars and [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks as hosts to [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*] and [$M.javanica#Virus*] was determined in pot and [$field experiment#Method*]s.
[$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*] showed higher reproduction than did [$M.javanica#Virus*] on [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks.
The [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*] did not differ in host status when challenged with these two species and supported lower nematode reproduction than the [$cucurbit #Plant*][$rootstocks#Plant*].
Rootstocks [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] cv.
Pelops and[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] AK15 supported lower reproduction than did the [$squash #Plant*]hybrid rootstocks ([$C.maxima#Plant*] 9 [$C.moschata#Plant*]).
Egg production increased (P < 0.05) with a rising initial inoculum level (Pi) in the non-grafted Sugar Baby but the reproduction factor Rf (eggs per plant/Pi) was similar at two Pi levels.
The total egg production in the plants grafted onto [$squash #Plant*]hybrids RS841 and Titan was greater (P < 0.05) at the higher Pi, but the Rf values were lower.
The development of field-grown non-grafted [$watermelon#Plant*] plants was significantly stunted in plots where nematodes were detected at planting.
However, no differences were observed in plots with grafted plants.
In plots with [$nematodes#Virus*], non-grafted and Titan-grafted plants had similar yields that were higher than that of RS841-grafted plants.
In the commercial plastic houses with grafted [$watermelon#Plant*], the average Rf value was 42-fold, confirming the high susceptibility of [$squash #Plant*]hybrids as rootstocks for grafted [$watermelon#Plant*].
The Titan-Sugar Baby combination was tolerant to [$M.javanica#Virus*].
