[@Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] is an RNA virus that belongs to the [$genus Potyvirus#Virus*], [$family Potyviridae#Virus*] and affects both [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*], causing great economic losses.
[$PRSV#Virus*] isolates are divided into biotypes P and W; both biotypes naturally [$infe#Plant*]ct plants in the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], whereas the P type also naturally infects [$papaya#Plant*] ([@Carica papaya L#Plant*]).
In the present study, we report the full-length genome sequence of two [$PRSV-P#Virus*] isolates sampled from the [@Campo Hermoso#Virus*] ([@PRSV-CH#Virus*]) and [@Villa del Rosario#Virus*] ([@PRSV-VR#Virus*]) localities in Norte de Santander, Colombia.
The genomes of these [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates are 10,326 nt in length and have a predicted ORF of 3344 aa.
The identity among Colombian [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates is 96.9% and 97.3% at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels, respectively.
[$PRSV#Virus*] isolates from China had the lowest identity at 78.3% and 89.2% (nucleotide-amino acid), whereas the highest identities were detected in [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates from Mexico, Venezuela and Hawaii.
At the polyprotein level, the amino acid composition surrounding the active polyprotein cleavage sites differ in the Colombian [$PRSV#Virus*] sequences.
The predicted cleavage site in P1/HC-Pro is LEQY/N - LEQY/S instead of MEQY/N.
Both of the Colombian [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates have a putative recombination event in the P1 coding region, which is common in all [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates from the American continent.
The new full-length [$PRSV#Virus*] sequences from Colombia provide a better understanding of the dynamics of [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] infections in [$papaya#Plant*] in Colombia and worldwide.
