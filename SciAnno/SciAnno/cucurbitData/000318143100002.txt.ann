Advanced agricultural and horticultural systems are a feature of pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas.
Practically all of the crops that originated in the New World were domesticated before European incursions.
Thus, the New World crops currently grown in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania should be considered as a contribution of indigenous cultures of the Americas to humanity.
The history of these indigenous [@crops#Plant*] can be found in the written post-Columbian record of explorers, correspondents, travelers, and botanists.
It can also be traced in the iconographic record derived from pre-Columbian artifacts, illustrated manuscripts, herbals, paintings, and sculpture.
This information is particularly useful for such fields as taxonomy, genetics, [$crop#Plant*] domestication, [$crop#Plant*] evolution, and genetic diversity.
Major New World [$crops#Plant*] to be reviewed include [$grains#Plant*] and [@pseudograins#Plant*] ([@amaranth#Plant*], [$maize#Plant*], [@quinoa#Plant*]),[$ legume#Plant*]s ([$common bean#Plant*], [$lima beans#Plant*], [$peanut#Plant*]), [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$chayote#Plant*], [$pumpkins#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*]), [@solanaceous fruits#Plant*] ([@capsicum peppers#Plant*], [@husk tomato#Plant*], [@pepino#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*]), [@starchy roots#Plant*] and [$tubers#Plant*] ([$cassava#Plant*], [$potato#Plant*], [$sweetpotato#Plant*]), [@fruit and nuts#Plant*] ([@blueberry#Plant*], [$brambles#Plant*], [@cactus pear#Plant*], [@cashew#Plant*], [$papaya#Plant*], [@pineapple#Plant*], [@strawberry#Plant*]), [@beverage crops#Plant*] ([@cacao#Plant*], [@mate#Plant*]), [$ornamentals#Plant*] ([@dahlia#Plant*], [@fuchsia#Plant*], [$sunflower#Plant*]), and [$industrial crops#Plant*] ([$cotton#Plant*], [@Para rubber#Plant*], [$tobacco#Plant*]).
