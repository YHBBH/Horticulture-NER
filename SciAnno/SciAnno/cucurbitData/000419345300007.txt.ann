This research investigated early hyphal development of [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] ([@Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*]) on leaves of [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]) acclimatized to different relative humidities to clarify the factors that limit it.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] were acclimatized to a low (10%) or high (90%) relative humidity (RH) at 30 degrees C from germination.
When the cotyledons had expanded and the first true leaf had begun to emerge, the plants were inoculated, and initial [$conidia#Virus*]l invasion, hyphal development, and secondary haustorial formation were evaluated.
The initial invasion of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] into the epidermis was slower on the low-RH leaves than on the high-RH leaves, suggesting that structural properties, such as greater leaf mass per area, physically limited the development of [@P.xanthii#Virus*].
The hyphal development and secondary haustoria of [$conidia#Virus*] that had successfully infected the epidermis were also slower on the low-RH leaves.
These post-invasion behaviors indicate that [$conidia#Virus*]l development was also suppressed by nonstructural properties of low-RH leaves such as nutrients, which correlate with nonstructural defense.
The reduced leaf N content of the low-RH leaves may in part have inhibited the post-invasion behaviors of [@P.xanthii#Virus*].
