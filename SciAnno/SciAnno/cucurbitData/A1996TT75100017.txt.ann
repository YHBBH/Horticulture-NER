[@Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) was isolated from [$zucchini squash#Plant*] on the island of Martinique for the first time in 1992, and it is now widespread on the island.
Fourteen isolates collected from different [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in 1992 and 1993 exhibited biological and antigenic variability as revealed by using differential hosts and a series of monoclonal antibodies.
A partial sequencing of the [$coat protein#Gene*] and putative polymerase coding regions of the 14 isolates revealed that there was also some molecular variability, lower within the group of Martinique isolates than with [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates from other geographical origins.
This variability can result either from the introduction to the island of different [$ZYMV#Virus*] strains, or from a rapid evolution of an introduced [$ZYMV#Virus*] population with a narrow genetic base.
The incidence of the observed variability will affect the development of efficient and durable control strategies.
