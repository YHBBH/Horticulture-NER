[@Cucurbit yellow vine disease#Disease*] ([$CYVD#Disease*]), caused by the [$squash #Plant*]bug ([$Anasa tristis#Virus*])-transmitted bacterium [$Serratia marcescens#Virus*], was first identified in Oklahoma and Texas in 1988 and in Georgia in 2012.
[$S.marcescens#Virus*] is a highly diverse species found in many ecological niches.
In previous studies, [$CYVD#Disease*] strains of [$S.marcescens#Virus*] formed a closely related group separate from non-[$CYVD#Disease*] strains based on biological and mo[$lecul#Virus*]ar characterization techniques.
[@Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of six housekeeping genes and repetitive elements-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) using the BOX and ERIC primers#Method*] were used to assess the genetic diversity of [$CYVD#Disease*] strains of [$S.marcescens#Virus*] collected in Georgia together with a strain from Texas and seven non-[$CYVD#Disease*] strains of [$S.marcescens#Virus*].
[$rep-PCR#Method*] results revealed genetic diversity among [$CYVD#Disease*] strains while [$MLSA#Method*] results showed a 100% similarity across the six loci for all but one of the [$CYVD#Disease*] strains, which differed at the icd locus by five polymorphisms.
For both methods, [$CYVD#Disease*] strains clustered separately from nonplant-[$pathogen#Virus*]ic [$S.marcescens#Virus*] strains and were most similar to a [$rice#Plant*] endophyte strain.
One [$CYVD#Disease*] strain isolated from a [$squash #Plant*]bug shared genetic similarities with non-[$CYVD#Disease*] strains, and may be the result of a recombination event between [$CYVD#Disease*] and non-[$CYVD#Disease*] strains.
