[@Zucchini yellow mosaic potyviru #Virus*]([$ZYMV#Virus*]), first isolated in Italy in 1973, described in 1981, and then identified in all continents within a decade, is one of the most economically important viruses of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
It is efficiently aphid-transmitted in a nonpersistent manner and it is also seed-home in [$zucchini squash#Plant*], which could have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
Biological variability has been observed among [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates, concerning host range, symptomatology and aphid transmissibility.
More recent studies also revealed a serological and molecular variability.
The survival of [$ZYMV#Virus*] in areas where cucurbits are not grown throughout the year remains to be elucidated, because very few natural over-wintering hosts have been identified so far.
Partial control of [$ZYMV#Virus*] can be achieved by limiting transmission of the virus to the crops by aphids, using adapted cultural practices.
Cross-protection with a mild strain has been shown to be effective against most [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates.
Resistance genes found in cucurbit germplasms as currently being introduced into cultivars with good agronomical characteristics.
Pathogen-derived resistance strategies using the expression of [$ZYMV#Virus*] genes in transgenic plants have also been developed and appear promising.
Nevertheless, the high biological variability of [$ZYMV#Virus*] justifies a careful evaluation of the deployment of genetic control strategies in order to increase their durability.
