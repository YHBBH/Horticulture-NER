A [@tospovirus#Virus*] isolate from Brazil, designated [@TSWV-B#Virus*], was first identified as a unique isolate based on our observation that [$transgenic plants#Plant*] expressing the N gene of the [$lettuce#Plant*] strain of [$tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([@TSWV-BL#Virus*]) were susceptible to [$TSWV-B#Virus*] but showed resistance to both [@TSWV (L type)#Virus*] and [$impatiens necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$INSV#Virus*]).
[$TSWV-B#Virus*] was serologically distinct from [$TSWV#Virus*] and [$INSV#Virus*].
[$TSWV-B#Virus*] generally incited symptoms resembling those caused by other [$TSWV#Virus*] isolates, except [$TSWV-B#Virus*] systemically infected Petunia hybrida, which is a local-lesion host of [$TSWV#Virus*].
Unlike the [$cucurbit #Plant*]isolate [$TSWV-W#Virus*], [$TSWV-B#Virus*] did not infect [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] and only occasionally induced systemic infections on C metuliferus.
The complete nucleotide sequence of the S RNA of [$TSWV-B#Virus*] was determined with cDNA clones to be 3,049 nucleotides long.
The genome organization of this S RNA was similar to those of [$TSWV#Virus*] and [$INSV#Virus*].
The alignment of the S RNA nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the homologous sequences of [$TSWV#Virus*] (isolates CNPH1, L3, and BL) and [$INSV#Virus*] revealed that [$TSWV-B#Virus*] was related more closely to all the [$TSWV#Virus*] isolates than to [$INSV#Virus*].
There was a higher degree of identity among the [$TSWV#Virus*] isolates than with [$TSWV-B#Virus*].
Thus, [$TSWV-B#Virus*] ap[$pears#Plant*] to be a distinct [$tospovirus#Virus*]; however, a precise classification requires additional biological and mo[$lecul#Virus*]ar information on this isolate as well as comparison to other [$tospovirus#Virus*] isolates.
