Among many species in the [@genus Tobamovirus#Virus*], [$Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$KGMMV#Virus*]) is known as a major seed-borne virus infecting [$cucurbit plants#Plant*], including [$melon#Plant*], which possesses no known resistance.
The identification of genetic resistance to [$KGMMV#Virus*] in Indonesia ([@KGMMV-YM#Virus*]) in [$melons#Plant*] is of economic importance.
Thus, 45 [$melon#Plant*] cultigens collected from 17 Asian countries were screened by manual virus inoculation and resistance to [$KGMMV-YM#Virus*] was examined by visual observation, [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] and [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]).
The results show that resistance to [$KGMMV-YM#Virus*] was found in 'Mawatauri', 'Kohimeuri', PI 161375 and PI 371795, and analysis by [$RT-PCR#Method*] showed the presence of [$KGMMV-YM#Virus*] in susceptible cultigens as early as 3 days after leaf inoculation.
