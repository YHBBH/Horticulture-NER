[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) is one of the most important [$pathogens#Virus*] that cause significant yield losses in many [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] including [$cucumber#Plant*] ([@Cucumis sativus L#Plant*]).
[$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*] is inherited by a single recessive gene.
The purpose of this study was to identify [$molecular markers#Method*] linked to the gene conferring [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*].
We developed a population of 188 F-2 plants derived from inbred [$cucumber#Plant*] lines.
Individual F-2 plants were self-pollinated to generate F-3 populations.
Ten randomly selected plants from each F-3 population were tested for [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance.
We used a bulk segregant analysis method to identify putative [$molecular markers#Method*] linked to [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance.
[@Using bulked DNA samples with parental lines and F-1, a total of 170 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP), 586 simple sequence repeat (SSR), and 308 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer#Method*] combinations were screened.
Neither [@polymorphic SRAP#Method*] nor [$SSR markers#Method*] were linked with [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance.
Among the 308 [$AFLP primer#Method*] combinations tested, an [@AFLP marker#Method*] in the E-ACA/MCA primer combination showed significant association among parental lines, F-1, and resistant and susceptible plants.
The combination of E-ACA/M-CA was achieved on parental lines, F-1, and 188 F-2 individuals for confirmation of the marker segregation on the F-2 population.
We found that the combination of E-ACA/M-CA was linked to the zym locus with 6.91 cM.
