The non-protein amino acid beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) enhances [$squash #Plant*]resistance to microbial [$pathogens#Virus*] through potentiation of the [$squash #Plant*]defense responses.
In the present study, we investigated the effects of BABA pretreatment on [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] disease.
Three concentrations of BABA (0.5, 2 and 4 mM) as priming media and distilled water as control plants were used.
The results showed that the 4 mM BABA was the most effective concentration to control the disease symptoms.
The expression of PR-1 gene in relation to this [$pathogen#Virus*] was investigated and confirmed.
Guaiacol peroxidase and Phenylalanine amonia-lyase enzymes activities increased in pretreated-inoculated [$squash plant#Plant*]s.
Bases on our results and regarding the adverse effects of fungicide on the environment, use of BABA as an environmentally safe agent is recommended as a valuable contribution to disease management.
