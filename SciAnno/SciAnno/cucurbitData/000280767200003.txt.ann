QoI fungicides which inhibit mitochondrial respiration at the ubiquinol oxidation centre (Qo site) of the cytochrome bc1 enzyme complex, are one of the most important class of agricultural fungicides.
QoI fungicides generally carry a high risk of pathogen resistance development with resistance occurring in over 30 pathogen species, such as [@powdery mildews#Virus*], [$downy mildews#Virus*], [$anthracnose#Virus*], [$Alternaria spp.#Virus*], scab, and grey mould.
Molecular mechanisms of QoI resistance have been intensively studied; a single point mutation which causes an amino acid change in cytochrome b, G143A in particular, was described to govern the expression of high resistance.
A range of molecular methods including [$PCR#Method*]-[$RFLP#Gene*], allele-specific [$PCR#Method*], [@quantitative real-time PCR#Method*] and pyrosequencing have been developed, enabling the rapid detection and quantification of resistance.
However, the status of heteroplasmy in the mitochondrial genome which contains the cytochrome b gene can cause instability over time, making it difficult to precisely monitor QoI resistance in some [$pathogens#Virus*].
The role of the alternative oxidase pathway in QoI resistance is not clear as yet, although this enzyme is very likely involved in resistance development of grey mould in particular.
Novel QoI fungicides have been developed, some of which show differential patterns of cross-resistance to pre-existing QoI fungicides.
This paper summarizes QoI resistance development over the last decade as well as future research prospects.
