 Field trials were carried out in northeastern Uttar Pradesh (India) to determine the effectiveness of the aphid parasitoid Trioxys indicus Subba Rao & Sharma against the cucurbit aphid Aphid gossypii Glover on Lagenaria vulgaris (bottle gourd), Luffa cylindrica (ghia torai) and Cucurbita maxima (pumpkin).
Two initial inoculative releases of the parasitoid with the rate of 10 mummies/m(2) during the first and third weeks of December decreased the population growth of the aphid on L.
vulgaris and L.
cylindrica.
A 20 to 50% reduction of the aphid number was noticed within 15 days after the first release in the fields on the two crops.
The second release of the parasitoid further reduced the population by up to 65-70%.
The rate of parasitism in natural conditions (control fields) and in experimental fields (where the parasitoids were released) was found to be density-dependent except in the fields of C.
maxima.
The results demonstrated the potential of T.
indicus against A.
gossypii in a cucurbit habitat.
