[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) is an emerging viral [$pathogen#Virus*] in [$cucurbit#Virus*]-growing areas wordwide.
Infection causes significant yield losses in several species of the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
To identify proteins potentially involved with resistance toward infection by the severe [$ZYMV#Virus*]-H isolate, two[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] cultivars (Zelena susceptible and Jaguar partially resistant) were analyzed using a two-dimensional [$gel electrophoresis#Method*]-based proteomic approach.
Initial symptoms on leaves (clearing veins) developed 6-7 days post-inoculation (dpi) in the susceptible [@C.pepo cv.Zelena#Plant*].
In contrast, similar symptoms appeared on the leaves of partially resistant [$C.pepo#Plant*] cv.Jaguar only after 15 dpi.
This finding was confirmed by immune-blot analysis which showed higher levels of viral proteins at 6 dpi in the susceptible cultivar.
Leaf proteome analyses revealed 28 and 31 spots differentially abundant between cultivars at 6 and 15 dpi, respectively.
The variance early in infection can be attributed to a rapid activation of proteins involved with redox homeostasis in the partially resistant cultivar.
Changes in the proteome of the susceptible cultivar are related to the cytoskeleton and photosynthesis.
