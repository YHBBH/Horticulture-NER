[@Dacus (Callantra) solomonensis Malloch#Virus*] is known to occur only in Solomon Islands and Bougainville.
There is no published information about its life history.
It is a major pest of [@snake gourd#Plant*], attacking both mature and immature fruits.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] ([@Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) and [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]) are also hosts.
   A small colony of [@D.solomonensis#Virus*] was begun in March 1996 using pupae obtained from [$snake gourd#Plant*].
Colony size was increased using whole fruits of [$snake gourd#Plant*] for egging.
Eggs have also been obtained using [$pumpkin#Plant*] domes.
At 25 degrees C, eggs hatched in about 46 hours.
Durations of larval and pupal stages were 12 and 9 days, respectively.
Larvae tolerate wet conditions, sometimes pupating inside the skin of [$snake gourd#Plant*].
This occurs both in the laboratory and in the field.
   The [$melon fly#Virus*], [@Bactrocera cucurbitae#Virus*] ([$Coquillett#Virus*]), is one of the world's worst pests on [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
A colony of [$melon fly#Virus*] was started in February 1996 using insects obtained from ripe fruits of a [@wild cucurbit vine#Plant*] ([@Coccinea grandis#Plant*]).
Successful reproduction was obtained using whole fruits of [$papaya#Plant*], or [$papaya#Plant*] domes transferred to a diet containing [$papaya#Plant*], torula yeast and nipagin.
From eggs placed directly on diet, larvae survived only in the absence of nipagin.
