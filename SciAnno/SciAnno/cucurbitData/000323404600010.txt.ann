[@Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) ([$family Closteroviridae#Virus*], [$genus Crinivirus#Virus*]) is an emerging virus which causes severe diseases on [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) plants.
[$CCYV#Virus*]-infected [$melon plants#Plant*] display yellowing, mottling, chlorosis, or chlorotic spots on leaves.
To develop a new control strategy, the potential for 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole-7-thiocarboxylic acid-S-methyl-ester (ASM) to suppress [$CCYV#Virus*] infection was evaluated.
ASM treatment on [$melon plants#Plant*] greatly increased the expression levels of [$pathogen#Virus*]esis-related la gene, a marker gene for systemic acquired resistance.
ASM treatment on [$melon plants#Plant*] before inoculation of [$CCYV#Virus*] suppressed systemic symptoms and decreased [$CCYV#Virus*] accumulation.
ASM treatment on [$melon#Plant*] even after inoculation of [$CCYV#Virus*] reduced disease severity and accumulation levels of [$CCYV#Virus*].
The results show the potential for ASM treatment on attenuation of the [$CCYV#Virus*] disease symptoms.
