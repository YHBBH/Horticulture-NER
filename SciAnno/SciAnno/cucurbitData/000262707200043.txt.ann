The various disease syndromes caused by [@Phytopthora capsici Leonian #Virus*]can be devastating to [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]) production areas of the United States.
In some growing seasons, yield loss has been reported up to 100%.
A recently developed University of Florida[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] breeding line, #394-1-27-12, resistant to the [$crown rot#Disease*] syndrome of A capsici, was used to determine the inheritance of resistance to this disease.
Data from F-1, F-2, and backcross progeny from crosses of a [$P.capsici#Virus*]-susceptible butternut-type [$winter squash#Plant*] ([$C.moschata#Plant*]) with #394-1-27-12 indicated that resistance is conferred by three dominant genes.
The introgression of A.capsici [$crown rot#Disease*] resistance from #394-1-27-12 into morphologically diverse domesticates within[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] will aid in the management of this economically important [$pathogen#Virus*].
