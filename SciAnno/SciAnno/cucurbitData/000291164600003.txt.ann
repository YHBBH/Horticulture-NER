Viral diseases are very detrimental to [@watermelon#Plant*] production.
[$Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] ([$WSMoV#Virus*]) is a major limiting factor for the production of [$watermelon#Plant*] and other [$cucurbit #Plant*]fruits.
There are no effective natural sources of resistance to [$WSMoV#Virus*], making transgenic resistance an appropriate solution for attenuating virus infection.
Hyperhydricity is an important problem in [$watermelon#Plant*] culture in vitro, resulting from lower multiplication rates, poor quality shoots and tissue necrosis.
In this study, we report an Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transfer protocol for commercial [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars expressing the nucleocapsid (N) gene of [$WSMoV#Virus*] and a suitable approach to overcome hyperhydricity in [$watermelon#Plant*] culture in vitro.
Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts containing Schenk and Hilde[$bran#Plant*]dt (SH) vitamins + 50 mg l(-1) thiamine HCl could diminish the hyperhydric phenotype.
The proximal halves of cotyledons from 3-day-old [$seedlings#Plant*] were cut into 1.5 x 1.5 mm segments as explants.
Four days after co-cultivation, the explants were transferred to a selection medium for shoot regeneration.
The putative transgenic shoots developed within 6 weeks of culture and were then transferred to stringent medium for 8 weeks to eliminate 'escape type' shoots.
Fifty putative transgenic [$watermelon#Plant*] lines were obtained from three cultivars.
[$PCR#Method*] and Southern blot analysis confirmed that the foreign gene was incorporated into the genomic DNA of the transgenic lines.
