The amino terminus (NT) of the potyvirus [@coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]), which is necessary for aphid transmission and systemic infection, is externally located on the virion, strongly antigenic, and highly variable in length and sequence.
Chimeras of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) were constructed by substitution Of the native [$CP#Gene*]-NT with [$CP#Gene*]-NTs of [$potyviruses#Virus*] with overlapping ([$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*]) and non-overlapping ([@Tobacco etch virus#Virus*], [@TEV#Virus*]) host range.
The chimeric viruses produced strong initial symptoms on [$ZYMV#Virus*]-susceptible [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Approximately 6 weeks post-inoculation, [$zucchini#Plant*] and [$Cucumber#Plant*] plants infected with the [$TEV#Virus*] chimera, exhibited a distinct recovery characterized by a loss of symptoms on young leaves, reduced virus titer, and [$Virus#Virus*]-specific protection against secondary infection.
The [@chimeric Viruses#Virus*] did not overcome naturally occurring [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*], [$ZYMV#Virus*]-[$CP#Gene*]-mediated resistance in transgenic [$melons#Plant*], or expand host range to [$TEV#Virus*]- or [$WMV#Virus*]-susceptible species.
These results demonstrate that despite substantial variability in length and sequence, the [$CP#Gene*]-NTs from heterologous [$potyviruses#Virus*] facilitated systemic infection in [$ZYMV#Virus*]-susceptible [$cucurbits#Plant*], but were not sufficient to cause infection in non-[$ZYMV#Virus*] hosts.
The observed recovery response with the non-[$cucurbit#Plant*] [$CP#Gene*]-NT suggests that the [$CP#Gene*]-NT is important for biological efficiency of the virus and/or adaptation of the virus to its host.
