[@Citrullus lanatus ssp.vulgaris oleaginous type#Plant*] ([@West-African watermelon#Plant*]) is a [$crop#Plant*] cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa for its dried seeds reported to be rich in nutrients.
In previous studies, little polymorphism was found in [$watermelon#Plant*]-cultivated for its flesh with the use of [$microsatellite (SSR) markers#Method*].
Such study has never been applied to the oleaginous type until now.
The objectives of the present study were firstly to apply the [$SSR markers#Method*] set up for [$watermelon#Plant*] to the [$West-African watermelon#Plant*] and secondly to study the genetic structure of this type in Ivory Coast.
For the first objective, 37 markers were studied on eight plants pertaining to four accessions.
For the second objective, the polymorphic markers were applied on three morphologically and geographically separated accessions with twenty plants per accession.
[@Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)#Method*], [@unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA)#Method*], [@molecular analysis of variance (AMOVA) and assignments test#Method*] structure were applied.
The optimal annealing temperature varied from 49 to 59A degrees C according to the markers.
Thirty-two markers that proved to amplify their respective loci were selected, but only nine of them appeared to show polymorphism on the set of 8 plants studied.
The application of these markers on the three accessions revealed several features.
No stucturation into sub-populations was observed inside a given accession.
The genetic variance proved to be substantially higher between the different accessions than inside a given accession.
Moreover this analysis is a first hint that the morphology classification does not match the genetic structure of [@C.lanatus#Plant*].
The results of this work provide the first quantitative information regarding the genetic variability of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] oleaginous type.
In order to sharpen our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the genetic variance inter/intra acces[$sions#Plant*], further studies based on a larger sample of plants and acces[$sions#Plant*] are required.
