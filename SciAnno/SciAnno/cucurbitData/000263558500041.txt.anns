Citrullus B-Plant
lanatus M-Plant
var.citroides E-Plant
( O
African B-Plant
melon E-Plant
) O
is O
a O
crop S-Plant
cultivated O
in O
sub-Saharan O
Africa O
for O
its O
dried O
seeds O
reported O
to O
be O
rich O
in O
nutrients. O

In O
this O
project O
the O
relationship O
between O
its O
mode O
of O
reproduction O
and O
its O
genetic O
diversity O
will O
be O
established. O

This O
relationship O
is O
particularly O
interesting O
as O
C.lanatus B-Plant
var.citroides E-Plant
has O
been O
evolving O
in O
a O
traditional O
farming O
system, O
under O
a O
low-anthropic O
selection. O

On O
the O
one O
hand, O
the O
accurate O
reproduction O
strategies O
of O
this O
species O
will O
be O
determined O
by O
studying O
the O
floral O
morphology, O
Occurrence O
of O
autoincompatibility, O
rate O
of O
allogamy. O

On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
genetic O
structure O
inside O
different O
accessions, O
and O
the O
associated O
population O
genetic O
flow O
will O
be O
established. O

This O
genetic O
structure O
of O
the O
species, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
rate O
of O
allogamy, O
will O
be O
analyzed O
with O
the O
use O
of O
microsatellite B-Method
(SSR) M-Method
markers E-Method
. O

The O
relevant O
rnicrosatellite O
markers O
have O
been O
set O
up O
for O
the O
watermelon S-Plant
. O

The O
resolution O
of O
these O
SSR B-Method
markers E-Method
has O
been O
performed O
for O
the O
C.lanatus B-Plant
var.citroides E-Plant
