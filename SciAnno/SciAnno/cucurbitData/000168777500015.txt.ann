[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) was described in 1981 affecting [$squash#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and other cultivated [$cucurbits#Plant*] with severe stunting and yellowing symptoms.
It was reported to be present in most countries where [$cucurbits#Plant*] are grown, and in Chile since 1995, from surveys using [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]) but without further characterization.
A [@potyvirus#Virus*] was isolated from [$ELISA#Method*]-positive symptomatic plants.
The results indicate that this virus is [$ZYMV#Virus*] based on symptoms on herbaceous indicators, [@immunospecific electron microscopy#Method*] of the purified particle, and sequencing of 395 bases of the 3' end of the [$coat protein#Gene*] gene.
The virus was detected in [$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]plants.
In agreement with previous descriptions for [$ZYMV#Virus*], the Chilean isolate is a flexuous filamentous particle 740 nm long with one main protein of approximately 36 kDa.
[@Nucleotide sequence comparisons#Method*] of the 3' portion of the [$coat protein#Gene*] gene revealed a high similarity to the Connecticut and California strains.
