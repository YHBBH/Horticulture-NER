Constitutive expression of the [@ORF0#Gene*] (open reading frame 0) gene product from the [@Potato leafroll virus#Virus*] ([@PLRV#Virus*]) in transgenic host [$potato#Plant*] plants is known to produce viral-disease-like symptoms.
To determine whether these symptoms were the result of a host-specific response to transgene expression, [$PLRV#Virus*] [$ORF0#Gene*] and the orthologous-[$ORF0#Gene*] genes of the closely related [@poleroviruses Beet western yellows virus#Virus*] ([@BWYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) were stably transformed into [$Solanum tuberosum#Plant*] and [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] plants.
Only [$potato#Plant*] plants expressing the [$PLRV#Virus*] [$ORF0#Gene*] displayed symptoms typical of virus infection, indicating a host-specific response of [$potato#Plant*] to the [$ORF0#Gene*] gene product of the naturally infecting virus [$PLRV#Virus*].
[$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] plants transgenic for [$PLRV#Virus*] [$ORF0#Gene*] were phenotypically indistinguishable from pBIN19-transgenic and nontransformed plants, and symptom development was not obtained with [$potato#Plant*] or [$tobacco#Plant*] plants transgenic for [$ORF0#Gene*] from [$BWYV#Virus*] or [$CABYV#Virus*].
Symptom development in [$potato#Plant*] plants transgenic for [$PLRV#Virus*] [$ORF0#Gene*] coincided with an abnormal sugar metabolism resulting in an unusually high accumulation of starch in mesophyll cells.
Tissue-specific expression of [$ORF0#Gene*] in [$potato#Plant*] tubers resulted in abnormal tuber formation, reduced dormancy, and increased starch accumulation.
