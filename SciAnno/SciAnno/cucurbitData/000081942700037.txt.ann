The study was conducted to determine the most available accelerated [@ageing test#Method*] conditions and construct survival curves for [@watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus vulgaris L.#Plant*]), [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) seeds.
In the first experiment, seeds were stored at 40 and 50 degrees C with 12 and 17% moisture contents for 30 days, and 50 degrees C with 17% up to 168 hours in the second experiment.
Full survival curves were not obtained with storing the seeds at 40 degrees C with any moisture content within 30 days for all three species.
But ageing at 50 degrees C, with 12% and 17% moisture content [$cucumber#Plant*] seeds died at the end of 5 days.
[$Melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds died between 5 and 10 days when stored at 50 degrees C with 17% moisture.
In the second experiment, ageing at 50 degrees C with 17% up to 168 hours gave perfect curves for [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds.
Ageing period needs to be extended for [$melon#Plant*] seeds.
   Results clearly showed that 50 degrees C with 17% moisture content can be used as a good ageing seed testing condition for [$cucurbit#Plant*] seeds, storage period is arranged according to the species.
Ageing period must be 3, 6 and up to 10 days in [$cucumber#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] seeds respectively.
