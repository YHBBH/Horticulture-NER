[@Cucurbits#Plant*] species grown in 38 of 40 agricultural regions in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were surveyed for the relative incidence of [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [@Papaya ringspot virus-type W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*]-2 ([$WMV-2#Virus*]), [@Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([@ZLCV#Virus*]), and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) during May 1997 and June 1999, Samples from 621 plants, representing eight cultivated species, six wild species, and one commercial hybrid ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] x [@C.maxima#Plant*]), were analyzed by plate trapped antigen [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([@PTA-ELISA#Method*]).
[$PRSV-W#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] were the most frequently found viruses, accounting for 49.1 and 24.8%, respectively.
of 605 samples tested.
[$ZLCV#Virus*], [$CMV#Virus*], and [$WMV-2#Virus*] were detected in 7.8, 6.0, and 4.5% of 612, 497, and 423 samples tested, respectively.
Double infection was found in 97 samples, and triple infection was found in 10 samples.
Quadruple infection was detected in one [@C.pepo#Plant*] sample.
Plants that were symptomatic but negative by [$PTA-ELISA#Method*] might be due to abiotic agents, infection by virus for which antiserum was not available, such as [@Squash mosaic virus#Virus*], or infection with an as yet uncharacterized virus.
