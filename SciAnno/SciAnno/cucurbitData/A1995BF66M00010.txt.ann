[@ Corn#Plant*],[$ tomatoes#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] have been transformed successfully with viral [$coat protein#Gene*] (cp) genes to generate inheritable disease resistance.
The effective amount of gene expression, and specificity of the protection vary depending on virus classification and viral sequences used to engineer protection.
Although mode of action is unknown, organs of [$transgenic plants#Plant*] contain les!; virus or viral protein than similar nontransgenic tissues exposed to natural infection.
Engineered resistance is important because viruses can not be controlled chemically, and up to 20% of [$crop#Plant*] losses are attributed to viral diseases as single or mixed infections.
A single [$corn#Plant*] virus may reduce yield 10-25%; however, when [@maize dwarf mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@MDMV#Virus*]) is combined with [$maize#Plant*] chlorotic mottle virus, mixed [$infe#Plant*]ction may cause 80-100% loss.
Cp-mediated control of one of the viruses prevents such severe yield losses.
Most agronomically important viruses are spread mechanically by farm equipment or biologically by insect or fungal vectors.
Engineered cp expression provides protection against viral spread if it occurs early in the plant's life cycle.
Use of biological or viral sequences, rather than chemicals, to control viruses or their vectors is safer for consumers and the environment.
