Three new cucurbitacins were isolated from the roots of [$Wilbrandia ebracteata#Plant*] and their structures established as 16-alpha,23-alpha-epoxy-2-beta,3-beta,20-beta-trihydroxy-10-alpha,23-beta-cucurbit-5,24-dien-11-one, 16-alpha,23-alpha-epoxy-2-beta,3-beta,20-beta-trihydroxy-10-alpha,23-alpha-cucurbit-5,24-dien-11-one and 2-beta,3-beta,16-alpha,20,25-pentahydroxy-10-alpha-cucurbit-5,23-dien-11-one, mainly by spectroscopy.
