The Japanese government legally restricts entry of the [@bacterial fruit blotch disease#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] caused by [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*].
However, the disease has occurred several times in Japan caused by infestations of [$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$wax gourd#Plant*] seeds with the [$pathogen#Virus*].
We prepared seeds infested with this [$pathogen#Virus*] for [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$wax gourd#Plant*] and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and treated the seeds with dry heat for disinfection from the [$pathogen#Virus*], varying the temperature and duration.
Percentages of seed infested with the [$pathogen#Virus*] were determined after the dry heat treatments.
The healthy or infested seeds (after the dry heat treatments) were sown in soil and the germination percentage evaluated.
Complete disinfection of seeds of [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and small-seeded [$squash #Plant*](and without preventing germination) was achieved with some dry heat treatments, with 85 degrees C for 35 day being preferable.
The large-seeded [$squash#Plant*], [$wax gourd#Plant*] and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] were sensitive to dry heat, additionally harsh conditions of =90 degrees C and 7 day at 85 degrees C were needed for complete disinfection.
Thus, there were no feasible conditions for seed disinfection without affecting germination for the large-seeded [$crops#Plant*].
