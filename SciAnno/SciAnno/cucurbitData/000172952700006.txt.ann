Mixed infections of [@cucurbits#Plant*] by [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) and [@potyviruses#Virus*] exhibit a synergistic interaction.
[$Zucchini#Plant*] [$squash #Plant*]and [$melon#Plant*] plants coinfected by the [$potyvirus#Virus*] [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) and either Fny-[$CMV#Virus*] (subgroup IA) or LS-[$CMV#Virus*] (subgroup II) displayed strong synergistic pathological responses, eventually progressing to [$vascular wilt#Disease*] and plant death.
Accumulation of Fny- or LS-[$CMV#Virus*] RNAs in a mixed infection with [$ZYMV#Virus*] in [$zucchini squash#Plant*] was slightly higher than infection with [$CMV#Virus*] strains alone.
There was an increase in [$CMV#Virus*] (+) strand RNA levels, but no increase in [$CMV#Virus*] (-) RNA3 levels during mixed infection with [$ZYMV#Virus*].
Moreover, only the level of capsid protein from LS-[$CMV#Virus*] increased in mixed infection.
[$ZYMV#Virus*] accumulated to similar levels in singly and mixed infected [$zucchini squash#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] plants.
Coinfection of [$squash #Plant*]with the [$potyvirus#Virus*] [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) and [$CMV#Virus*] strains increased both the Fny-[$CMV#Virus*] RNA levels and the LS-[$CMV#Virus*] RNA levels.
However, [$CMV#Virus*] (-) strand RNA3 levels were increased little or not at all for [$CMV#Virus*] on coinfection with [$WMV#Virus*].
Infection of [$CMV#Virus*] strains (LS and Fny) containing satellite RNAs (WL47-sat RNA and B5*-sat RNA) reduced the accumulation of the helper virus RNA, except when B5*-sat RNA was mixed with LS[$CMV#Virus*].
However, mixed infection containing [$ZYMV#Virus*] and the [$CMV#Virus*] strains with satellites reversed the suppression effect of satellite RNAs on helper virus accumulation and increased satellite RNA accumulation.
The synergistic interaction between [$CMV#Virus*] and [$potyviruses#Virus*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*] exhibited different features from that documented in [$tobacco#Plant*], indicating there are differences in the mechanisms of [$potyvirus#Virus*] synergistic phenomena.
