Oriental [@melon plants#Plant*], [@Cucumis melo var.makuwa cv.Silver Light#Plant*], showing virus-induced symptoms of mosaic, leaf curl and puckering were observed in the fields of eastern Taiwan in 2007.
A virus culture, designated as SL-1, isolated from the diseased [$melon#Plant*] was established in systemic [$host plants#Plant*], [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] and oriental [$melon#Plant*], by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*].
SL-1 did not react to the antisera against common [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting RNA viruses.
Viral DNAs extracted from the diseased plant were amplified with the degenerate primers for [$begomoviruses#Virus*].
The full-length genomic DNA-A and DNA-B of SL-1 were sequenced and found to be closest, with 97.7% and 90.6% nucleotide identity, respectively, to [@Tomato leaf curl New Delhi begomovirus#Virus*] ([@ToLCNDV#Virus*]) [$cucumber#Plant*] isolate from a group of [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$begomoviruses#Virus*].
The virus SL-1 was designated as [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] oriental [$melon#Plant*] isolate ([@ToLCNDV-OM#Virus*]).
The [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of [$ToLCNDV-OM#Virus*] was confirmed by agroinfection.
Progeny virus from the agroinfected N.benthamiana plants was able to infect oriental [$melon#Plant*] by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*] and caused symptoms similar to the original diseased [$melon#Plant*] in the field.
The [$ToLCNDV-OM#Virus*] also infected five other species of [$cucurbit#Plant*]aceous plants by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*].
This is the first report of a new [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] isolate causing severe disease on oriental [$melon#Plant*] in Taiwan.
