[@Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]), a member of the [$genus Crinivirus#Virus*], is transmitted by the [$whitefly Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] and causes yellowing of leaves of [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
The [$melon#Plant*] accession JP 138332 is resistant to [$CCYV#Virus*].
Here, we detected a single QTL conferring resistance to [$CCYV#Virus*] in [$melon#Plant*].
Two susceptible accessions (Harukei No.
3' and AnMP-5') were crossed with JP 138332 to generate two mapping populations.
Each F-2 population was evaluated for [$CCYV#Virus*] resistance in a greenhouse with the use of [$CCYV#Virus*]-infected [$B.tabaci#Virus*], and genetic linkage maps were constructed using SSR and Indel markers.
The map of the F-2 population derived from Harukei No.
3', with 12 linkage groups, comprises 171 markers, which span 1538cM, with an average interval between markers of 9.7cM.
The map of the F-2 population derived from AnMP-5', also with 12 linkage groups, comprises 179 markers, which span 1419cM, with an average interval of 8.5cM.
QTL analysis using each population detected one locus in the same region on chromosome 1, explaining 46.5-50% of the phenotypic variance.
This is the first report of QTL mapping for [$CCYV#Virus*] resistance.
