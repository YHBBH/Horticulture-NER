The phylogenctic relationships within the [@genus Cucumis#Plant*] (a total of 25 accessions belonging to 17 species) were studied using the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region.
The analysis included commercially important species such as [$melon#Plant*] ([$C.melo L.#Plant*]) and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$C.sativus#Plant*]).
Two additional [$cucurbit#Plant*] species, [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$zucchini#Plant*], were also included as outgroups.
The data obtained reflected the clustering of [$Cucumis#Plant*] species in four main groups, comprising accessions from [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [@C.metuliferus#Plant*] and the wild African species.
Some of the species clustered in different positions from those reported in classifications previously described by other authors.
The data obtained clearly identify a division between the 2n = 2x = 14 species ([@C.sativus#Plant*]) and the 2n = 2x = 24 ones ([$C.melo#Plant*] and wild species).
Within the wild species we identified a subgroup that included [@C.sagittatus#Plant*] and [@C.globosus#Plant*].
[@Oreosyce affricana#Plant*], also classified as [@Cucumis membranifolius#Plant*], was shown to be nested within [$Cucumis#Plant*].
Three accessions previously classified as independent species were shown to be genotypes of [$Cucumis melo#Plant*].
A set of [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] SSRs were also used to analyse the [$Cucumis#Plant*] species and the results were compared with the ITS data.
The differential amplification of the SSRs among the acces[$sions#Plant*] made it possible to distinguish three main groups: [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and the wild species, though with less detail than applying ITS.
Some SSRs were shown to be specific for [$melon#Plant*], but other SSRs were useful for producing [$PCR#Method*] fragments in all species of the genus.
