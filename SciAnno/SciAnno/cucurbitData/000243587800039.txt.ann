The entire open reading frame (ORF) of [@nucleocapsid (N) or nonstructural (NSs) protein#Gene*] encoded by S RNA of [$Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] ([$WSMoV#Virus*]) was inserted in between the [@PI and HC-Pro genes#Gene*] of the [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) vector for expression in planta.
Six histidine residues and an additional Nla protease cleavage site were introduced to facilitate the purification and the process of free-form proteins, respectively.
Symptoms of mosaic and leaf distortion on [$zucchini squash#Plant*] were induced by [@the chimeric viruses ZWSMoV-N#Virus*] and [@ZWSMoVNSs#Virus*] carrying the N and NSs ORFs of [$WSMoV#Virus*], respectively.
The expressed N and NSs proteins were purified from infected tissues by the Ni2+-NTA affinity column.
Our results indicate that the constructed [$ZYMV#Virus*] vector can efficiently express tospoviral proteins in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
