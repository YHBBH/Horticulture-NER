[@Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] ([$anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum#Virus*]), which causes [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*], occurs throughout the eastern United States.
Other [$Phoma spp.#Virus*], such as [@P.exigua#Virus*], also have been reported to cause symptoms of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*].
Twenty-seven isolates provisionally identified as [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]or [$Phoma spp#Virus*].
were obtained from diseased [$watermelon#Plant*], [$cantaloupe#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]grown in South Carolina, New York, and Florida.
[$D.bryoniae #Virus*]was clearly distinguished from [$Phoma#Virus*] after 7 days of growth on quarter-strength [$potato#Plant*]-dextrose agar at 24 C with a 12-h photoperiod.
[$D.bryoniae #Virus*]produced white aerial mycelium, olivaceous green substrate mycelium, and few pycnidia; [$Phoma#Virus*] produced sparse aerial mycelium and numerous pycnidia, sometimes in concentric zones.
The percent monoseptate [$conidia#Virus*] for [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]isolates ranged from 0 to 18%, whereas no [$Phoma#Virus*] isolate produced any septate [$conidia#Virus*].
Seventeen of 19 [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]isolates were pathogenic on [@watermelon cv.Charleston Gray#Plant*] and [@cantaloupe cv.Classic#Plant*]; all eight isolates of [$Phoma#Virus*] and two isolates of [@D, bryoniae#Virus*] were non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic.
Genomic DNA was extracted from all 27 isolates described above plus two additional isolates of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]from New York and one from Florida.
DNA was amplified using [$PCR#Method*] primed with random oligonucleotide decamers.
[$RAPD#Method*] amplification patterns clearly differentiated [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]from [$Phoma#Virus*].
Each of five primers used produced two to four amplified fragments that were unique either to all [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]or to all [$Phoma#Virus*] isolates.
Thirteen additional fragments were present in all [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]isolates except two of the three isolates from New York.
