The herbicide clomazone (trade name Command 480EC) is about to be registered in Australia.
Registrations already exist in a number of other countries including the United States and New Zealand.
All current registrations are for preemergence use on [$crops#Plant*] including [$potatoes#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$cotton#Plant*], [$corn#Plant*] and [$soybeans#Plant*].
Work conducted in Tasmania over the past five years has shown that clomazone is very efficacious for control of certain emerged [$weeds#Plant*] in [$poppy#Plant*] ([$Papaver somniferum#Plant*]) [$crops#Plant*].
In many cases clomazone provides greater [$weed#Plant*] control with less [$crop#Plant*] damage than current commercial standard products.
Clomazone used alone provides control of [$Chenopodium album#Plant*], [$Stachys arvensis#Plant*] and [$Polygonum aviculare#Plant*], with useful suppression of [$Amaranthus powellii #Plant*]and to a lesser extent [$Raphanus raphanistrum#Plant*].
In most commercial situations clomazone will be used in conjunction with other herbicides to provide control of all [$weeds#Plant*] present.
The ability to control emerged [$weeds#Plant*] with clomazone represents a significant breakthrough as the product has previously only been used pre-emergence.
This is of particular benefit in [$poppies#Plant*] where the use of pre-emergence herbicides is not favoured.
