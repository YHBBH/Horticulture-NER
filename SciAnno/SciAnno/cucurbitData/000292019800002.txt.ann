A new strain of [@cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] incited by [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]([@Castagne#Virus*]) Braun & Shishkoff (formerly [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]), designated race S, is virulent on all the commonly used [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*])[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] race differentials and first ap[$pea#Plant*]red on [$melon#Plant*] in Yuma, AZ, and Imperial Valley, CA, in 2003.
[$Melon#Plant*] PI 313970 ([@C.melo var.acidulus#Plant*]) was resistant to [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race S in 2003 and subsequent years.
Inheritance of resistance to [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race S was studied in two naturally infected, replicated field tests in Imperial Valley in 2005 and 2009 using the parents and F(1), F(2), and reciprocal backcross generations from crosses of PI 313970 with[$ powdery mildew#Virus*]-susceptible 'Top Mark'.
Resistance to race S was recessive: all F1 and BC(TM) individuals were susceptible.
One recessive gene, designated pm-S, conditioned resistance to race S in the F(2) and BC(PI),.
The relationship of pm-S to the previously reported recessive and codominant genes in PI 313970 for resistance to [$P.xanthii#Plant*] races 1, 2, 2U.S., 3, 3.5, 4.5, and 5 remains to be determined.
