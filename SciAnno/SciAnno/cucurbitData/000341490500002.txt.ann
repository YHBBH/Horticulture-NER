More than [@fifty viruses#Virus*] have been reported in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide.
In Ecuador, approximately 3,000 ha of [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumbers#Plant*] are cultivated annually, but there have been few studies to identify viruses responsible for epidemics.
During this study, sequencing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) extracted from [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] leaves showing virus-like symptoms revealed the presence of [$Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([$MYSV#Virus*], [@genus Tospovirus#Virus*]) and the partially described [@Cucumis melo endornavirus#Virus*] ([@CmEV#Virus*]).
Specific primers, designed to detect each virus, showed that [$MYSV#Virus*] was present in 40, 64 and 67 % of symptomatic [$watermelon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] samples, respectively.
For [$CmEV#Virus*], 95 % of both symptomatic and asymptomatic [$melon plants#Plant*] tested positive.
However, the virus was not detected in [$watermelon#Plant*] or [$cucumber#Plant*].
Sequence comparisons showed nucleotide identities of 97 % and 94 % for the polymerase and the [$nucleocapsid protein#Gene*], respectively, between the Ecuadorean [$MYSV#Virus*] and the one reported from Japan.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of [$MYSV#Virus*] and [$CmEV#Virus*] in Ecuador and the Americas.
