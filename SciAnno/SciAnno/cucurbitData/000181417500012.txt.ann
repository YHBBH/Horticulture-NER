Viruses are a serious threat to [@cucurbit#Plant*] production in southern Illinois.
The most prevalent viruses infecting [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in the region were determined during the 1998, 1999, and 2000 growing seasons to enable growers to make better decisions on viral disease management.
[$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) was the most prevalent virus as it was found in approximate to84% of samples over the three years.
[$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), and [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) were detected in approximate to8%, 6%, 9%, and 1% of samples, respectively, over the 3-year period.
[$WMV#Virus*] was generally the only virus isolated from samples collected before mid-September.
Other viruses, including [$CMV#Virus*], [$PRSV#Virus*], [$SqMV#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*], Were generally first detected after mid-September and were usually round as mixed infections with [$WMV#Virus*].
