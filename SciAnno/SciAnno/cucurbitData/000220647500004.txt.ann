[@Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins#Gene*] ([@PGIPs#Gene*]) are believed to aid in plant defense against [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] by inhibiting polygalacturonases (PGs) secreted by the invading organism.
In an effort to better understand this type of plant-pathogen interaction in [$cucurbits#Plant*], we have isolated a [$cantaloupe#Plant*] [@PGIP#Gene*] ([@CmPGIP#Gene*]) from 5 to 15 day postanthesis [$cantaloupe#Plant*] fruit.
[$CmPGIP#Gene*] inhibited crude extracts of PG from two of four [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] of [$cantaloupe#Plant*] that were tested.
Results from assays for PG activity that utilized rate of substrate viscosity reduction or rate of reducing group formation were consistent with [$CmPGIP#Gene*] inhibition of endo-PG activity.
The M, of [$CmPGIP#Gene*] by sedimentation equilibrium or MALDI-TOF MS was 38,500.
The pI of [$CmPGIP#Gene*] was approximate to8.2, and its absorptivity at 280 nm was 0.93 ml/mg.
The circular dichroism spectrum of native [$CmPGIP#Gene*] exhibited strong negative ellipticity in the near UV and possessed a far UV spectrum indicative of beta-sheet periodic structure.
Amino acid sequences of the N terminus and a cyanogen bromide peptide were used to construct oligonucleotide primers for [@polymerase chain reaction sequencing#Method*].
The sequenced open reading frame predicts a mature protein of 307 amino acids with up to 68% identity to other [$PGIP#Gene*] molecules.
[$Northern blot analysis#Method*] revealed differential expression during fruit development.
The isolation and structural information obtained for [$CmPGIP#Gene*] by this investigation provide a foundation for the development of molecular strategies for pre- and postharvest [$crop#Plant*] protection.
