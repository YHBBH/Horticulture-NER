Glasshouse experiments were conducted at the Newe Ya'ar Research Center in the winter seasons of 1992/93 and 1993/94 to examine a phosphorus/potassium (PK) fertilizer for cucurbit crops.
Monopotassium phosphate [(MKP), KH2PO4] was found to be very effective as a P and K source for cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) plants grown in soilless container conditions.
The efficiency of MKP was essentially not different from that of the combination of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and potassium chloride (KCl) which is widely used in the commercial production of vegetables.
Appropriate fertilization of cucumbers with MKP in 1992/93 affected late-season yield more than early-season yield.
Deficiency of P and K in Gala muskmelon inhibited vegetative growth and decreased yield.
The reduced yield resulted from both less fruit-setting and smaller fruit size.
The MKP rates required by cucumber plants in 1993/94 depended primarily on growth medium composition.
Generally, plants grown in inert tuff (volcanic gravel) and sandy media responded more significantly to MKP than did those grown in media rich in organic matter.
There are at least three reasons for preferring the use of MKP, first it is much safer to handle than is H3PO4, second it is highly soluble and can be easily incorporated in fertigation systems, and third it has a high PK content.
