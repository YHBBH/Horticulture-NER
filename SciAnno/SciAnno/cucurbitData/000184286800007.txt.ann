The susceptibility of mefenoxam-treated [@cucurbit plants#Plant*] to infection by isolates of [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] that were sensitive (S), intermediately sensitive (IS), and fully insensitive (I) to mefenoxam in vitro was investigated to determine if in vitro screening will accurately predict the response of mefenoxam-treated [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] to infection by [$R capsici#Virus*].
Isolates were recovered from a cross between IS parents or from naturally infected [$cucumbers#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$pumpkins#Plant*], and [$peppers#Plant*] in Michigan, New York, and North Carolina.
[@Pumpkin#Plant*] or [$yellow squash#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] were treated with water or mefenoxam at either 19.17 mug/ml or 57.51 mug/ml 24 h prior to inoculation.
Four days after inoculation, all of the isolates of [$R capsici#Virus*] exhibited similarly high virulence on the water-treated [$seedlings#Plant*].
The diameter of the lesions produced by S, IS, and I isolates on mefenoxam-treated [$seedlings#Plant*] ranged from no visible lesions for S isolates to lesions indistinguishable from those produced on water-treated plants for I isolates.
These findings are consistent with the expectations based on in vitro screening and suggest that in vitro screening of mefenoxam sensitivity using a single high rate of mefenoxam (100 ppm) provides useful information for predicting the response of natural populations of P.
capsici to mefenoxam.
