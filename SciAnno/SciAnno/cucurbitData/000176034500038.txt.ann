In a [@yellow summer squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L#Plant*].) experimental line developed by Seminis Vegetable Seeds, the [$coat protein#Gene*] gene of an American strain of [@squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]-M88), conferred resistance to Arizona, California, New Jersey, and New York strains belonging to the two pathotypes of the virus.
An [@analysis of genetic populations#Method*] derived from crosses and reciprocal backcrosses of a homozygous [$SqMV#Virus*]-resistant line A127-1-2 with the susceptible cultivar Butterbar revealed that the high level of resistance mimics the response of a single recessive gene.
