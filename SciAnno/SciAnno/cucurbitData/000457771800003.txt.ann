Two surveys were conducted in September 2014 and July 2015 in important [$vegetable#Plant*]-growing areas in Azerbaijan.
[$Cucurbit#Plant*] and [$solanaceous plants#Plant*] exhibiting symptoms of mosaic, yellowing, leaf curl or necrosis were collected and tested serologically and molecularly for the presence of the major viruses infecting these [$crops#Plant*].
For [$cucurbits#Plant*], the most common viruses in both sampling sets were aphid-transmitted ones, including [$potyviruses#Virus*] ([$watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*], [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*]), cucumoviruses ([$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*], [$CMV#Virus*]) and [$poleroviruses#Virus*] ([$cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*], [$CABYV#Virus*]).
[@Eggplant mottled dwarf#Virus*] ([@EMDV#Virus*]) was also detected for the first time in Azerbaijan on [$cucumber#Plant*] at a low prevalence.
In [$solanaceous crops#Plant*], [$CMV#Virus*] was the most common virus detected, followed by [@potato virus Y#Virus*] ([@PVY#Virus*]).
[$Tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$TSWV#Virus*]), [@alfalfa mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@AMV#Virus*]) and [$tobamoviruses#Virus*] ([@tomato mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$TMV#Virus*]), [@pepper mild mottle virus#Virus*] ([@PMMoV#Virus*])) were also detected in 2015.
The [$begomovirus#Virus*] [$tomato#Plant*] yellow leaf curl virus ([$TYLCV#Virus*]) was present on [$tomato#Plant*] only in the Absheron area, where it had a high prevalence and induced important losses.
[$TYLCV#Virus*]-like symptoms on [$tomato#Plant*] in other areas of Azerbaijan were due to phytoplasma diseases.
