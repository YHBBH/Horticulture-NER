Plant-fungal specificity between  and [@Diaporthe sclerotioides#Plant*], the causal agent of [$black root rot#Disease*], was studied using [$cucumbers#Plant*] ([@Cucumis sativa#Plant*]),[$ melons#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$pumpkins#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]), [$watermelons#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) and [@bottlegourd#Plant*] ([@Lagenaria siceraria var.gourda#Plant*]).
Twelve [@D.sclerotioides#Virus*] isolates from these [$cucurbit species #Plant*]were cross-inoculated.
The virulence of the isolates was evaluated as the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC).
All [$cucurbit species #Plant*]were susceptible to each isolate, but AUDPCs were significantly different among the hosts, with the order of greatest to least being [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$bottlegourd#Plant*] and finally, [$pumpkin#Plant*].
The infectiveness of isolates was assessed as the quantity of [$D.sclerotioides#Virus*] DNA detected in the hypocotyls of [$seedlings#Plant*] 2weeks after inoculation using a [$real-time PCR#Method*] protocol.
The fungal DNA quantities varied among the species in the same order as the AUDPCs.
Whilst there were statistically significant correlations between the virulence and infectiveness of [$D.sclerotioides#Virus*] isolates in [$cucumbers#Plant*],[$ melons#Plant*] and [$bottlegourd#Plant*]s, their coefficients of determination were not high (r(2)<06).
Orthogonal contrasts indicated no specificity in either the fungal virulence or infectiveness between [$D.sclerotioides#Virus*] isolates and the [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts from which these isolates originated.
Thus, although the degree of host susceptibility to [$D.sclerotioides#Virus*] varies among [$cucurbit species#Plant*], the absence of specificity to the host species in either virulence or infectiveness suggests the [$pathogen#Virus*] may spread via various [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], irrespective of their original host species.
