[@Bacillus amyloliquefaciens#Virus*] CECT 8237 and CECT 8238, formerly known as [$Bacillus subtilis#Virus*] UMAF6639 and UMAF6614, respectively, contribute to plant health by facing microbial [$pathogens#Virus*] or inducing the plant's defense mechanisms.
We sequenced their genomes and developed a set of ad hoc scripts that allowed us to search for the features implicated in their beneficial interaction with plants.
We define a core set of genes that should ideally be found in any beneficial [$Bacillus#Virus*] strain, including the production of secondary metabolites, volatile compounds, metabolic plasticity, cell-to-cell communication systems, and biofilm formation.
We experimentally prove that some of these genetic elements are active, such as i) the production of known secondary metabolites or ii) acetoin and 2-3-butanediol, compounds that stimulate plant growth and host defense responses.
A comparison with other [$Bacillus#Virus*] genomes permits us to find differences in the cell-to-cell communication system and biofilm formation and to hypothesize variations in their persistence and resistance ability in diverse environmental conditions.
In addition, the major protection provided by CECT 8237 and CECT 8238, which is different from other [$Bacillus#Virus*] strains against bacterial and fungal [$melon#Plant*] diseases, permits us to propose a correlation with their singular genetic background and determine the need to search for additional blind biocontrol-related features.
