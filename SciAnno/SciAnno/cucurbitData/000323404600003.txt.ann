The causal agent of [@cucurbit bacterial wilt#Disease*], [@Envinia tracheiphila#Virus*], has a wide host range in the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], including economically important [$crops#Plant*] such as [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([@C.sativus#Plant*]), and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]).
Genetic variability of 69 [$E.tracheiphila#Plant*] strains was investigated by repetitive-element [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$rep-PCR#Method*]) [@using BOXA1R and ERIC1-2 primers#Method*].
Fingerprint profiles revealed significant variability associated with [$crop#Plant*] host; strains isolated from [@Cucumis spp.#Plant*]
were clearly distinguishable from [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]-isolated strains regardless of geographic origin.
Twelve [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] strains isolated from [$muskmelon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], or[$ summer squash#Plant*] were inoculated onto [$muskmelon#Plant*] and[$ summer squash#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*], followed by incubation in a growth chamber.
[$Wilt#Disease*] symptoms were assessed over 3 weeks, strains were reisolated, and [$rep-PCR#Method*] profiles were compared with the inoculated strains.
[$Wilt#Disease*]ing occurred significantly faster when [$seedlings#Plant*] were inoculated with strains that originated from the same [$crop#Plant*] host genus (P<0.001).
In the first run of the experiment, [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$muskmelon#Plant*] strains caused wilting on [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] at a median of 7.8 and 5.6 days after inoculation (dai), respectively.
Summer [$squash #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*] wilted 18.0, 15.7, and 5.7 dai when inoculated with [$muskmelon#Plant*]-, [$cucumber#Plant*]-, and [$squash#Plant*]-origin strains, respectively.
In a second run of the experiment, [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$muskmelon#Plant*] strains caused wilting on [$muskmelon#Plant*] at 7.0 and 6.9 dai, respectively, whereas[$ summer squash#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] wilted at 23.6, 29.0 and 9.0 dai when inoculated with [$muskmelon#Plant*]-, [$cucumber#Plant*]-, and [$squash#Plant*]-origin strains, respectively.
Our results provide the first evidence of genetic diversity within [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] and suggest that strain specificity is associated with plant host.
This advance is a first step toward understanding the genetic and population structure of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*].
