 A 3,9-kb genomic DNA fragment from the [@cucurbit#Plant*] [$pathogen#Virus*] [@Fusarium solani f.sp.cucurbitae race 2#Virus*] was cloned.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] revealed an open reading frame of 690 nucleotides interrupted by a single 51-bp intron.
The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences showed 92 and 98% identity, respectively, to those of the [@cutA gene#Gene*] of the [@pea pathogen#Virus*] [@F.solani f.sp.pisi#Virus*].
A gene replacement vector was constructed and used to generate [@cutA#Gene*](-) mutants that were detected with a [$polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay#Method*].
Seventy-one [$cutA#Gene*]- mutants were identified among the 416 transformants screened.
Vector integration was assessed by Southern analysis in 23 of these mutants.
[$PCR#Method*] and Southern analysis data showed the level of homologous integration nas 14%.
Disruption of the [$cutA#Gene*] locus in mutants was confirmed by [@RNA gel blot hybridization#Method*].
Neither virulence on [@Cucurbita maxima cv#Plant*].
Delica at any of six different inoculum concentrations, nor [$pathogenicity#Plant*] on intact fruit of four different species or cultivars of [$cucurbit#Plant*] or hypocotyl tissue of [$C.maxima#Plant*] cv.
Crown, was found to be affected by disruption of the [$cutA gene#Gene*].
