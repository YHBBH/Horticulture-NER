Since 2002 chloropicrin (CP) (TripicrinTM, 94% w/w of active ingredient) has been registered in Italy and primarily used on [@tomato#Plant*], [$strawberry#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], or[$chard#Plant*] and [$cut flowers#Plant*] in order to control[@ soilborne disease#Disease*] and, with the combination of 1,3 dichloropropene (1,3 D), [$root knot nematodes#Virus*].
All the most popular soil fumigants, including CP and 1,3 D, are now under revision or have been recently revised according to the EU regulation 91/414.
Due to the revision process 1,3 D availability has been reduced and limited to a define period of time according to so called "emergency uses".
With this scenario where several trials were carried out on protected[$ tomatoes#Plant*] in Southern Italy and primarily aimed at evaluating the effects of chloropicrin at different rates within 200-400 kg/ha against [$root knot nematodes#Virus*] ([@Meloidogyne spp.#Virus*]).
Trials were carried out under protected [$crops#Plant*] and soil was fumigated adopting the drip fumigation technique.
CP was tested alone or combined with reduced rates of 1,3 D.
An untreated control and a standard fumigated control [chloropicrin (300 kg/ha) and 1,3 D (240 kg/ha)] served as reference to quantify the efficacy of tested soil disinfestation strategies.
The results clarified that chloropicrin alone reduce the severity of [$root knot nematodes#Virus*] compared with the untreated control, but the mixture of chloropicrin and 1,3 D performed better.
