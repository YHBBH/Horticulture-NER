In Summer and Autumn of 2010, blighted [@cucurbits#Plant*] suspected of bacterial infection were observed in the East Azarbayejan province of Iran.
Infected plants exhibited spots on the leaves which, in the early stages of the disease, appeared as small, yellow and water-soaked with chlorotic haloes.
As time went by, the spots enlarged, necrotized and coalesced so as to cover a large area of the blade, while the leaves rolled along their longitudinal axis.
Such symptoms had not previously been observed in [$cucurbits#Plant*] in East Azarbayejan.
To investigate the etiology of this disorder, symptomatic leaves were collected from affected plants and the putative agent was isolated and identified as [$Pseudomonas#Virus*] syringae pv.
aptata based on morphological, physiological, biochemical, molecular and [$pathogenicity tests#Method*].
In [@BOX-PCR#Method*], four bacterial isolates from [$cucurbits#Plant*] formed a coherent group and their sequences showed a high similarity (99%) with [@P.syringae pv.aptata#Virus*] GSPB1067, as confirmed by [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] based on gyrB and rpoD.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf blight and necrosis of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae caused by [$P.syringae pv.aptata#Virus*] in Iran.
