Seed protein profiling of 34 lines of [@Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]
from different geographic regions of the world were evaluated for their polypeptide patterns and their phylogenetic relationship with other taxa of the [$genus Cucurbita#Plant*].
Considerable variations were observed in the polypeptide patterns of various lines on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reduced conditions, i.e.
seed protein extract with 2-mercaptoethanol.
The variations were observed in five different molecular weight regions, i.e.
in the range 64-70, 53-60, 30-41, 20-26 and 18-20 kDa.
[$Cluster analysis#Method*] showed 100% genetic similarity between [$C.pepo#Plant*] and [@C.pepo var.pepo#Plant*] whereas it is quite distinct from [@C.pepo var.texana#Plant*] and [@C.pepo var.fraterna#Plant*].
On the basis of electrophoretic profiling [$C.pepo var.texana#Plant*] and [@C.pepo var.fraterna#Plant*] should be considered as different species and also supports the origin of [$C.pepo#Plant*] from [@C.texana#Plant*].
