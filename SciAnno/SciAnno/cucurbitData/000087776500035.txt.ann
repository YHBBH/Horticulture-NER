Eight commercial cultivars of [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], one from each of the eight edible-fruited morphological groups (morphotypes), were studied for resistance to [$downy mildew#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*]) and [$powdery mildew of cucurbits#Disease*] ([$Erysiphe cichoracearum#Virus*], [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]) under growth chamber conditions and artificial inoculation.
The degree of resistance/susceptibility was expressed by intensity of sporulation and/or spore production per leaf area.
Significant differences in resistance/susceptibility to both mildews were found between morphotypes.
Generally, there was an inverse relationship detected in resistance to the two [@mildews#Disease*].
While [$zucchini#Plant*], [$cocozelle#Plant*] and [$vegetable marrow#Plant*] were highly resistant to [$P.cubensis#Virus*], they had relatively high [$powdery mildew#Disease*] sporulation.
Cultivars with the fruit type a[$corn#Plant*], [$straightneck#Plant*] and [$ornamental gourd#Plant*] were quite susceptible to [@P.cubensis#Virus*].
They were, however, considered resistant to [$powdery mildew#Disease*] in laboratory and field evaluations.
Among the morphotypes studied, the [$pumpkin#Plant*] was the most susceptible to both [$pathogens#Virus*].
Apparently the genes for resistance to the two [$mildews#Disease*] are not coupled in [@C.pepo#Plant*].
