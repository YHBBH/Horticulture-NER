Damping-off disease affects most greenhouse [@cucumber crops#Plant*] in Oman with losses frequently exceeding 25% of [$seedlings#Plant*].
Different local and introduced rootstocks were assessed for their response to [$Pythium aphanidermatum#Virus*] infection.
Rootstocks were tested for grafting compatibility and production potential under greenhouse conditions.
During in vivo infection tests, no infection was observed in [$C.moschata#Plant*] x [$C.maxima#Plant*] varieties Hercules and Titan, Indian [$ridge gourd#Plant*] and Omani [$sponge gourd#Plant*].
In [$greenhouse tests#Method*], Titan and Hercules hybrids and [@squash var.Magda#Plant*] showed no infection up to 45 days after transplanting.
Magda (58%) and Hercules (80%) and Titan (84%) had highest compatibilities with [$cucumber#Plant*] variety Zena.
Titan and Hercules rootstocks significantly increased vegetative growth of Zena [$cucumber#Plant*].
Titan and Hercules rootstocks significantly increased fruit number and weight compared to the control.
However, Zena grafted on Zena and Salalah [$cucumber#Plant*] produced significantly less yield compared to the non-grafted Zena control.
Titan and Hercules, [@Salalah cucumber#Plant*], [@Magda squash#Plant*], [@Omani sponge gourd#Plant*] and [@Indian ridge gourd#Plant*] rootstocks significantly increased fruit length, and improved fruit diameter and total soluble solid (TSS).
No damping off infection was observed on Titan and Hercules rootstocks during either greenhouse season.
