[@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] causes root.
crown, and fruit rot of [$tomato#Plant*], a major [$vegetable#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] grown worldwide.
The objective of this study was to screen [$tomato#Plant*] cultivars and wild relatives of [$tomato#Plant*] for resistance to [$P capsici#Virus*].
Four [$P capsici#Virus*] isolates were individually used to inoculate 6-week-old [$seedlings#Plant*] (1 g of [$P capsici#Virus*]-infested [$millet#Plant*] seed per 10 g of soilless medium) of 42 [$tomato#Plant*] cultivars and wild relatives of [$tomato#Plant*] in a greenhouse.
Plants were evaluated daily for wilting and death.
All [$P capsici#Virus*] isolates tested caused disease in [$seedlings#Plant*] but some isolates were more [$pathogen#Virus*]ic than others.
A wild relative of cultivated [$tomato#Plant*], [@Solanum habrochaites#Plant*] accession LA407, was resistant to all [$P capsici#Virus*] isolates tested.
Moderate resistance to all isolates was identified in the host genotypes Ha7998, Fla7600, Jolly Elf, and Talladega.
[$P capsici#Virus*] was frequently recovered from root and crown tissue of symptomatic inoculated [$seedlings#Plant*] but not from leaf tissue or asymptomatic or control plants.
The phenotype of the recovered isolate matched the phenotype of the inoculum.
Pathogen presence was confirmed in resistant and moderately resistant [$tomato#Plant*] genotypes by species-specific [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] of DNA from infected crown and root tissue.
Amp titled fragment length polymorphisms of [$tomato#Plant*] genotypes showed a lack of correlation between genetic clusters and susceptibility to [$P capsici#Virus*].
indicating that resistance is distributed in several [$tomato#Plant*] lineages.
The results of this study create a baseline for future development of [$tomato#Plant*] cultivars resistant to [$P capsici#Virus*].
