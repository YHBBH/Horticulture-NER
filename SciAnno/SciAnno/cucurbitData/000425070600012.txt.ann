Bactrocera cucumis is a lesser known native [$fruit fly#Plant*] in Australia.
There are 44 reported hosts including [$cucurbits#Plant*], [@papaws#Plant*] and[$ tomatoes#Plant*] with a strong preference for [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Adult flies are not attracted to the known male lures such as cuelure, methyl eugenol or zingerone.
They are weakly attracted to protein lures and a recently discovered [$cucumber#Plant*] volatile.
For this reason, surveillance for this [$fruit fly#Plant*] remains problematic.
Its range is predominantly coastal and appears to be centred north of Rockhampton in Queensland.
It is known in the Northern Territory, Queensland and in New South Wales north of 29 degrees S latitude.
Internationally, it is not reported in any Pacific countries or other parts of the world.
