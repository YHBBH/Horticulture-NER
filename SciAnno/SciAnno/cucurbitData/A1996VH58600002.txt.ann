Three [@melon#Plant*]-growing regions in the Central Valley of California were surveyed for the incidence and severity of [$watermelon mosaic virus 2#Virus*] ([@WMV2#Virus*]), [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), and [$papaya ringspot virus-watermelon strain#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), during 1988 and 1989.
[$WMV2#Plant*] was the most prevalent virus in all three regions (Yolo/Sutter/Yuba counties, Stanislaus County, and Merced/Fresno counties), both in the number of sites with infected plants and in the proportion of symptomatic plants within each site.
[$CMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] were detected in fewer sites and generally infected 20% or fewer symptomatic plants within a site.
In Stanislaus County, [$ZYMV#Virus*], which had not previously been reported in the Central Valley, was detected in a higher number of sites and a higher proportion of plants per site in 1989 than in 1988.
The increased incidence of [$ZYMV#Virus*] is of concern because this virus is severely [$pathogen#Virus*]ic.
[$PRSV-W#Virus*] was detected in low levels in the growing areas of Stanislaus and Merced/Fresno counties.
This study suggests that management strategies for dealing with virus diseases in the agriculturally diverse Central Valley will be specific to each particular region.
