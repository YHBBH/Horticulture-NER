P>[@Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([$MYSV#Virus*]), a member of the genus [$Tospovirus#Virus*], is a serious thrips-transmitted virus of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Japan.
Resistant cultivars provide an effective means for reducing the impact of the disease; however, no [$MYSV#Virus*]-resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] has been reported.
Susceptibilities of 398 [$cucumber#Plant*] accessions originating from 26 countries were evaluated by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*] of [$MYSV#Virus*].
Thirteen accessions from South Asia, South East Asia and unknown origin had low disease severity indices ([$DSI#Method*]s), and 10 of them showed no necrotic le[$sions#Plant*] on inoculated leaves.
No or little positive reaction was detected by [@DAS-ELISA analysis#Method*] of inoculated leaves of these acces[$sions#Plant*].
27028930 showed resistance to a [$melon#Plant*] isolate ([$MYSV-S#Virus*]) of [$MYSV#Virus*], and 'Yamakyuri-1' showed moderate resistance to a [$cucumber#Plant*] isolate (FuCu05P).
