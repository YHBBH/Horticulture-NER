[@ Perithecia of Sphaerotheca fuliginea (Schlecht.ex Fr.) Poll.#Virus*], the causal organism of [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] obtained from [@Lagenaria leucantha (Duch.) Rusby#Plant*] and [@Cucumis sativus Linn#Plant*], were subjected to various treatments but failed to form ascospores.
Perithecia on stem portions and leaf discs were kept in plastic tubes and incubated at -5, 5, 10, 17, 22, 25 and 30 degrees C for 220 days and paired combinations of 5/17; 5/22; 5/25; 10/17; 10/22 and 10/25 degrees C for the same period (220 days).
In an another treatment, these were kept in small terylene bags and burried in the soil.
The results suggest that a prolonged exposure of perithecia to soil environment and different temperatures does not help in the maturation of ascospores and their germination.
