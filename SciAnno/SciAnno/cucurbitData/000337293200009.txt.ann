The objective of this study was to identify viral species infecting pumpkin in the Khartoum and Gezira states of Sudan, and to evaluate the genetic variability among members of the same viral species.
A total of 60 symptomatic [@pumpkin#Plant*] leaf samples were collected from three different locations throughout the Khartoum state, and examined for viral incidence.
Symptoms observed varied from mosaic, malformation, blistering of the leaves and stunting.
[@Degenerate genus-specific and species-specific primers#Method*] were used for the detection of common [$cucurbit viruses#Virus*].
Results showed that the highest incidence (21.7%) was for [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), followed by (18.3%) [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), and (15%) [$Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]).
Single and multiple infections with more than one virus were detected.
The partial nucleotide sequences of the regions encoding CI and [$CP#Gene*], [$CP#Gene*], [$HSP70#Gene*]h, and AV2 proteins of [$ZYMV#Virus*], [$CYSDV#Virus*], [$CCYV#Virus*] and [$WmCSV#Virus*], respectively, have been deposited in NCBI GenBank.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] based on nucleotide sequences showed no or little variation among the studied viral isolates since each of them grouped well with its corresponding reference species.
