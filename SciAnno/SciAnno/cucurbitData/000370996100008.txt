The aphid-transmitted Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus (MWMV; Potyvirus, Potyviridae) is an emerging pathogen in cucurbit crops in the Mediterranean basin but information on its transmitting vector species is limited.
This study aimed to record the competence of 22 species of the Greek aphid fauna to vector MWMV.
Timed-probe transmission experiments and arena tests were performed using laboratory colonies of aphid species abundant in field surveys; less common species were tested as apterous individuals collected directly from field plants in mass-inoculation (nonpersistent) tests.
Depending on the test, aphids were tested in cohorts of 10 or 20 individuals on zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) plants and the frequency of transmission was calculated for a single aphid.
Among 12 species tested in timed-probe transmission tests, Myzus persicae nicotianae (74.0%) appeared to be the most efficient vector, followed by M.
persicae (48.0%), Aphis gossypii (11.8%), an unidentified Aphis sp.
(11.8%), and A.
spiraecola (11.0%).
Alatae of nine species tested in arena tests transmitted the virus in rates varying from 0.7 to 53.6%; M.
persicae was the most efficient species in virus spread.
In mass-inoculation tests, the probability that apterae of 12 aphid species collected from field plants transmitted MWMV fluctuated from 0.3 to 5.3%.
No transmission was obtained by Brevicoryne brassicae.
The following species are reported as new vectors of MWMV: A.
fabae, A.
nerii, A.
spiraephaga, A.
umbrella, Capitophorus eleaegni, Dysaphis (Pomaphis) pyri, Macrosiphoniella sanborni, Macrosiphum rosae, Myzocallis castanicola, Myzus persicae nicotianae, M.
cerasi, M.
varians, Phorodon humuli, Ovatus crataegarius, Takecallis arundicolens (first report in Greece), Uroleucon sonchi, and U.
(Uromelan) aeneum.
These results contribute to a better understanding of MWMV epidemiology.
