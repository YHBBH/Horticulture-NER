A shoot regeneration protocol was developed for five cultivars of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
The influence of [@the seed coat, an ethanol pre-treatment, different seed sources, NaOCl concentrations and treatment times on decontamination were investigated#Method*].
The effects of combinations of BA, kinetin, iP and TDZ with IAA in the culture medium on shoot regeneration of cotyledonary explants were tested.
The cultivars [$Cucurbita maxima #Plant*]cv.A-line, [@C.maxima cv.Chicago Warted#Plant*] and [@C.pepo cv.Rolet#Plant*], did not form shoots on any of the treatments.
However, somatic embryos formed on [@C.maxima cv.Chicago Warted#Plant*] explants.[@Cucumis melo cv.Hates Best 36#Plant*] was highly regenerable and shoots formed on all the treatments containing cytokinin.
The shoot regeneration response was significantly higher on BA-containing media than with the other [@cytokinins tested#Method*].
Although [@Cucumis sativus cv.Ashley#Plant*] responded poorly, shoot development was observed on media containing BA or iP.
