Surveys of [@yellowing viruses#Virus*] under nonheated and geothermal heated plastic tunnels and in open [$field crops#Plant*] of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$C.sativus#Plant*]), [$zucchini#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), [$squash #Plant*]([$C.maxima#Plant*]), [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]), and ware [$cucurbit #Plant*]([$Ecballium elaterium#Plant*]) were carried out year-round during 2000-2001, 2003, and 2004 in the major [$cucurbit#Plant*]-growing areas in Tunisia.
Severe yellowing symptoms on older leaves of [$cucurbits#Plant*] were observed in open fields and under plastic-tunnel production systems.
These yellowing symptoms and large populations of aphids ([@Aphis gossypii#Plant*]) on a diversity of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Tunisia support the hypothesis of a viral cause of the disease.
[$Virus#Virus*] identification using double-antibody sandwich [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]), followed by [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) and [@immunocapture (IC)-RT-PCR#Method*] showed that [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) was largely distributed in [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
Ware [$cucurbit #Plant*]([@E.elaterium#Plant*]) and [$lettuce#Plant*] ([$Lactuca sativa#Plant*]) [$crops#Plant*] were identified as potential [$CABYV#Virus*] reservoirs.
The [$RT-PCR#Method*]-amplified partial [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) and P4 genes were cloned and sequenced from nine Tunisian [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates.
[$CP#Gene*] and P4 gene nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons as well as phylogenetic reconstructions showed that the Tunisian isolates clustered into two major subgroups.
Comparisons with [$CABYV#Virus*] sequences retrieved from GenBank showed high nucleotide and [$CP#Gene*] amino acid identities, and close relationships of the Tunisian isolates with Italian and French isolates.
