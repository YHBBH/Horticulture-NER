Pathological interrelations of two [$soil-borne diseases#Disease*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$watermelon#Plant*], [$oriental melon#Plant*],[@ shintosa#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*]) caused by [$Fusarium#Virus*] isolates (FI) and the [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] ([$RKN#Virus*]), [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*] were characterized by the fusarium disease severity index (DI), [$RKN#Virus*] gall index (GI) and eggm ass index (El) in inoculation tests using FI and [$RKN#Virus*].
Virulence of FI as determined by DI at 4 weeks after inoculation was mostly in the higher order of [$Fusarium#Virus*] proliferaturn F6, F5 and [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] or [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] with no significant differential interactions among the [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$RKN#Virus*] co-infection.
Significant increases of DI due to [$RKN#Virus*] coinfection were noticed in [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$oriental melon#Plant*] infected with E proliferatum isolates, suggesting the DI increase due to [$RKN#Virus*] coinfection may depend upon the virulence of FI relative to aggressiveness of [$RKN#Virus*] on the [$cucurbits#Plant*].
For the coinfection of FI and [$RKN#Virus*], GI and EI were mostly reduced logarithmically with the increase of DI, largely more in EI than GI, in all [$cucurbits#Plant*] except for[$ shintosa#Plant*].
Microscopic examination of the root tissues showed histopathological features characteristic to infection types; formation of fungal hyphae and/or spores and plant defense structures (tyloses and mucilage) in variable degrees and formation of giant cells at variable developmental stages and with variable cytoplasmic depletion or de-generation which were visualized in relations with the values of DI, GI and EI.
These findings will be helpful to develop control strategies of the soil-borne disease complex based on their pathological characteristics.
