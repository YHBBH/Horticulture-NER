[@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] is the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch disease#Disease*] of [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*].
The disease was first reported in 2005 in Cukurova Region, Turkey.
In summer of 2009-2011, severe disease symptoms and significant economic losses were observed on [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus cv.Blade, Zeugma, Crisby and Starburst#Plant*]) and [$melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo cv.Surmeli#Plant*]) in some villages of Adana and Osmaniye in the region.
Pathogen is seedborne and first inoculum sources are infected seeds or [$seedlings#Plant*].
Initial symptoms in nurseries observed water soaked small lesions on cotyledons.
Reddish brown to dark brown, irregular and rarely greasy symptoms can be observed on [$watermelon#Plant*] true leaves.
Pathogen can get through true leaves to fruit.
Mostly, dark oil green lesions are observed on pericarp of fruit.
Those lesions surround the entire fruit surface within 5-8 days; brown cracks, amber colored and foaming like stream appears on diseased fruit.
Symptoms on [$melon#Plant*] are light brown, water soaked and irregular spots on true leaves, brown, receding lesions and cracks on surface and finally soften and rotten of [$melon#Plant*] observed.
The disease caused significant economical losses and nearly 5000 da [$watermelon#Plant*] fields were quarantined by the authorities and banned to grow [$watermelon#Plant*] or other [$cucurbits#Plant*] for 4 years in the region.
Many [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon seedlings#Plant*] were destroyed in the nurseries because of the disease.
In the PhD study, of 85 bacterial strains, 70 strains from [$watermelon#Plant*] and 15 strains from [$melon#Plant*] were isolated from diseased [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon plants#Plant*].
The strains were identified as [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] according to the morphological, physiological, biochemical, [$pathogenicity#Plant*] and [@PCR tests#Method*].
Based on the studies, occurrence and outbreak of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] of [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*], causal agent of [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] were determined in Cukurova Region.
