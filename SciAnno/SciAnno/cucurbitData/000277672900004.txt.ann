[@Cucurbit Morale yellows virus#Virus*] ([@CCYV#Virus*]) causes chlorotic yellows on [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) and [$melon#Plant*] ([@Commis melo#Virus*]) and is transmitted by [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] biotype B and Q [$whiteflies#Virus*].
To characterize the host range of [$CCYV#Virus*], 21 [@cucurbitaceous#Plant*] and 12 other plant species were inoculated using [$whitefly#Virus*] vectors.
All tested [@Cucumis spp.#Plant*]
except Commis argotic? and [@Cucumis zeyheri#Plant*] were systemically infected with [$CCYV#Virus*], although infection rates varied among species.
[$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], and [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] were susceptible to [$CCYV#Virus*]; however, the infection rates were low and symptoms were unclear.
In addition to the [$cucurbitaceous#Plant*] plants.
[$Beta vulgaris#Plant*].
[$Chenopodium amaranticolor#Plant*], [$Chenopodium quinoa#Plant*], [$Spinacia oleracea#Plant*], [$Lactuca sativa#Plant*], [@Datum stramonium#Plant*], and [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] were also systemically infected by [$CCYV#Virus*].
Complete RNA1 and RNA2 were reverse-transcribed, cloned, and sequenced.
[$CCYV#Virus*] RNA1 was found to be 8,607 nucleotides (nt) long and contained four open reading frames (ORFs).
The first ORF spanned methyltransferase and RNA helicase domains followed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, presumably translated by a +1 ribosomal frameshift.
[$CCYV#Virus*] RNA2 was found to be 8,041 nt long and contained eight ORFs, including the hallmark gene array of the [$family Closteroviridae#Virus*].
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] demonstrated that [$CCYV#Virus*] was genetically close to [$Lettuce chlorosis virus#Virus*].
Bean yellow disorder virus, and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*].
Amino acid sequence similarities of representative proteins with these viruses indicated that [$CCYV#Virus*] should be classified as a distinct crinivirus species.
