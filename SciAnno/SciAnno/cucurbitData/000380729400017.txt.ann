BACKGROUNDDespite being of great importance to [$crop#Plant*] protection, the disadvantages of intensive and inappropriate use of pesticides have stimulated the search for more selective and less harmful agrochemicals.
Thus, we have evaluated the effectiveness of 16 synthetic molecules (phthalides and precursors) to control the [$melon#Plant*]worm Diaphania hyalinata, a key pest in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] of economic importance in Brazil.
The selectivity to beneficial organisms Solenopsis saevissima and Tetragonisca angustula and the phytotoxicity to [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] of the promising insecticides were also assessed.
   RESULTSIn the screening assay, compounds 1 and 6 provided 91 and 88% mortality of the [$melon#Plant*]worm.
Compound 1 presented higher toxicity (median lethal dose LD50 = 15.99 mu mol g(-1)) and higher speed on pest control (median survival time LT50 = 420 min) than compound 6 (LD50 = 44.51 mu mol g(-1) and LT50 = 840 min).
Both compounds inhibited less than 11% of host-plant growth and caused 36 and 93% mortality of predator and pollinator respectively.
   CONCLUSIONAmong the tested compounds, only compounds 1 and 6 were effective in [$melon#Plant*]worm control.
Both compounds presented no considerable phytotoxicity and were selective to predator but non-selective to pollinator, which enables their application for pest control if the exposure of the bees is minimised.
