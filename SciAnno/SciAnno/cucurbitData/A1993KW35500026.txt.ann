[@Cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]) and horned [$cucumber#Plant*] ([@C.metuliferus Naud.#Plant*]) germplasm were evaluated for their resistance to [@root-knot nematodes#Disease*] ([$Meloidogyne spp.#Virus*]).
All 24 [@C.metuliferus#Plant*] cultigens evaluated were resistant to ail [@root-knot nematodes#Disease*] tested-[@M.incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood race 3#Virus*], [@M.arenaria (Neal) Chitwood race 2#Virus*], and [@M.hapla Chitwood#Virus*].
All 884 [$C.sativus#Plant*] cultigens (cultivars, breeding lines, and plant introduction accessions) tested were resistant to [@M.hapla#Virus*] and few to [@M.incognita race 3#Virus*].
Only 50 of 884 [$C.sativus#Plant*] cultigens evaluated were somewhat resistant to [$M.arenaria#Virus*] race 2 and [$M.incognita race 3#Virus*].
A retest of the most resistant [$C.sativus#Plant*] cultigens revealed that LJ90430 [an accession of [@C.sativus var.hardwickii (R.) Alef.#Plant*]] and 'Mincu' were the only cultigens that were moderately resistant to [@M.arenaria race 2#Virus*].
LJ90430 was the only cultigen, besides the two retested [$C.metuliferus#Plant*] cultigens, that was resistant to [@M.javanica (Treub) Chitwood#Virus*].
All [$C.sativus#Plant*] cultigens retested, including LJ90430, were highly susceptible to [@M.incognita races 1 and 3#Virus*].
The two [$C.metuliferus#Plant*] cultigens retested were highly resistant to all [@root-knot nematodes#Disease*] tested-[$M.arenaria race 2#Virus*], [$M.incognita races 1 and 3#Virus*], and [$M.javanica#Virus*].
