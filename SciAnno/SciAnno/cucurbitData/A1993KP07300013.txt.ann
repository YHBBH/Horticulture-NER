A [@potyvirus#Virus*] (designated as no.656) causing mosaic or vein-banding symptoms on[$ melons#Plant*] was isolated and characterized.
The virus was mechanically transmitted to 14 herbaceous plant species, and induced mosaic symptoms in most [@cucurbitaceous plants#Virus*].
[$Aphis gossypii#Virus*] transmitted the virus non-persistently, and flexuous filamentous virus particles c.
755 nm in length were consistently observed in extracts of the infected [$pumpkin#Plant*] leaf tissues.
Pinwheel and tubular inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm of infected [$zucchini#Plant*] leaf tissues.
The virus was purified from infected [$pumpkin#Plant*] leaves by isopycnic centrifugation (CS2SO4).
The molecular weights of purified capsid and cylindrical inclusion proteins as estimated by SDS-PAGE were 32-5 and 73 KDa, respectively.
In [$SDS-immunodiffusion tests#Method*], antiserum to virus particles from isolate 656 was serologically unrelated to [$ZYMV#Virus*], [$WMV-2#Virus*], PRV-W and a type W variant of PRV, but antiserum to its cylindrical inclusion protein did produce spur precipitin bands between homologous and [$WMV-2#Virus*] antigen wells.
However, neither [$WMV-2#Virus*] virus particle nor cylindrical inclusion antisera reacted with this virus.
Furthermore, this virus was not serologically related to[$ BCMV#Virus*], [@BYMV#Virus*], [$CYVV#Virus*], [@SMV#Virus*], [@WMV-M#Virus*] or [$ZYFV#Virus*].
Based on test results and symptomatology, this virus appears to be a new [$potyvirus#Virus*], for which the name [@melon vein-banding mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@MVbMV#Virus*]) is proposed.
