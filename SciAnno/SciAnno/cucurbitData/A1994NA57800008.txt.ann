Two vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) and four physiologic races (0, 1, 2, and 1-2) were identified among 122 isolates of [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] in Israel, One VCG corresponded to the previously described VCG0135, whereas the other, VCG0138, is new and was divided into two subgroups.
VCG0135 contained isolates of races 0 and 2, and VCG0138 contained isolates of races 0, 1, and 1-2.
In one region with a long history of [@cucurbit#Plant*] cropping, all races and VCGs were found within 17 km of each other, suggesting a high diversity of the [$pathogen#Virus*] within a relatively small area.
Based on vegetative compatibility, it is suggested that in Israel race 2 could have evolved from race 0 of VCG0135, and races 1 and 1-2 from race 0 of VCG0138.
