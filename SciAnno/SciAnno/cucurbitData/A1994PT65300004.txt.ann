[@ Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] was shown to be the principal species associated with [$Phytophthora blight#Virus*] of [$peppers#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Ohio during 1992 and 1993.
 Both A1 (31.5%) and A2 (64.2%) compatibility types were found in [$peppers#Plant*], and only A2 isolates were obtained from [$cucurbits#Plant*].
 [$Phytophthora cactorum#Virus*] was recovered from two [$cucurbit #Plant*]samples.
 The Alert [$Phytophthora#Virus*] ''flow-through'' immunoassay and the Agri-Screen multiwell [$ELISA#Method*] kit E for [$Phytophthora#Virus*] were compared for their efficacy.
 The former detected [@P.capsici#Virus*] in [$pepper#Plant*] and [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], and had the advantage of being rapid (10 min) and easy to perform.
 The latter was effective in detecting [@P.capsici#Virus*] in [$pepper#Plant*] tissue, but absorbance values for healthy [$cucurbit #Plant*]tissues were relatively high.
 Agreement between [$ELISA#Method*] and isolation of [@P.capsici#Virus*] or P.cactorum on semiselective medium was excellent for both kits.
 [$Phytophthora#Virus*] antigen was detected in three of seven field soils using the [$ELISA#Method*] kit E combined with a soil organic matter extraction-concentration protocol.
