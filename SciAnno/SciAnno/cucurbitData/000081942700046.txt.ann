This study was carried out to determine the harmful and beneficial insect fauna of [@cucurbit#Plant*] [$vegetables#Plant*] including [$muskmelon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]in the Southeastern Anatolian region of Turkey.
Studies were conducted in Diyarbakir and panlyurfa provinces in 1993-1994.

Most important harmful species were [@Aphis gossypii Glov#Virus*].
([$Homoptera#Virus*], [@Aphididae#Virus*]) on [$watermelon#Plant*], [@Myopardalis pardalina Bigot#Virus*] ([$Diptera#Virus*], [@Tephritidae#Virus*]) on [$muskmelon#Plant*], [@Aphtona sp.#Virus*]
([$Coleoptera#Virus*], [@Chrysomelidae#Virus*]) on [$cucurbit#Plant*], and [@Empoasca decipiens Paoli#Virus*] ([$Homoptera#Virus*], [@Cicadellidae#Virus*]) on [$squash #Plant*]and [$cucurbit#Plant*].
Out of these harmful insect species [@Bruchidius kamtshaticus Mast#Virus*].
