Epiphytic survival of [@Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*] on [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]).

96:62-66.
   [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*], the causal agent of [$bacterial wilt#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*], is transmitted by striped ([$Acalymma vittatum#Virus*]) and spotted ([@Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi#Virus*]) [$cucumber#Plant*] beetles.
Transmission occurs when infested frass with [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] is deposited on plant surfaces with fresh feeding wounds.
However, it is unclear whether the [$pathogen#Virus*] can survive as an epiphyte on leaves.
Experiments were conducted in controlled environments to monitor [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] survival on [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) leaves under various temperature and moisture conditions.
In the first experiment, [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] that had been spray inoculated with a rifampicin-resistant strain of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] were incubated at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35 degrees C (+/- 2 degrees C) at >= 95% relative humidity, and [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] populations were monitored for 72 h.
In the second experiment, [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] was monitored during alternating 12-h wet and dry periods, or continuous wet or dry conditions for 48 h at 20 degrees C.Survival of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] on wet [$muskmelon#Plant*] leaves depended on temperature (P < 0.01), with the greatest survival at 10 and 15 degrees C and least at 30 and 35 degrees C.Leaf wetness also impacted survival; an initial 12-h dry period resulted in a 1,000- to 10,000-fold reduction in population size, followed by stabilization of the surviving population.
These results demonstrate that [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] can survive on [$muskmelon#Plant*] leaves under a wide range of environmental conditions, suggesting that epiphytic populations might serve as a reservoir of inoculum for infections.
