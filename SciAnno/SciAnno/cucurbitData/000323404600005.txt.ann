[@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] causes significant loss to [$pepper#Plant*] production in China, and our objective was to investigate the population structure in Gansu province.
Between 2007 and 2011, 279 isolates were collected from [$pepper#Plant*] at 24 locations.
Isolates (or subsets) were assessed for simple sequence repeat (SSR) genotype, metalaxyl resistance, mating type, and physiological race using cultivars from the World Vegetable Center (AVRDC) and New Mexico recombinant inbred lines (NMRILs).
The A1 and A2 mating types were recovered from nine locations and metalaxyl-resistant isolates from three locations.
A total of 104 isolates tested on the AVRDC panel resolved five physiological races.
None of 42 isolates tested on the NMRIL panel caused visible infection.
SSR genotyping of 127 isolates revealed 59 unique genotypes, with 42 present as singletons and 17 having 2 to 13 isolates.
Isolates with identical genotypes were recovered from multiple sites across multiple years and, in many cases, had different race types or metalaxyl sensitivities.
Isolates clustered into three groups with each group having almost exclusively the A1 or A2 mating type.
Overall it appears long-lived genetically diverse clonal lineages are dispersed across Gansu, outcrossing is rare, and functionally important variation exists within a clonal framework.
