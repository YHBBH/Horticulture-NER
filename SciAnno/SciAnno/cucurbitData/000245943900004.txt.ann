[@Melon#Plant*] is a worldwide extended [$cucurbit#Plant*].
Spain is the 5(th) world [$melon#Plant*] producer and leader in Europe.
The [$melon#Plant*] genome is relatively small and its genetic map has an estimated size of 1,021 cM, which represents approximately 440 kb per cM.
These data make it a very attractive species for performing studies at the genomic level.
Recently, the "Spanish Genomics and Proteomics Strategic Action Programme" has funded the project "Development of genomic tools in [$melon#Plant*] for the analysis of resistance to [$pathogens#Virus*] and fruit quality traits" involving five Spanish laboratories with wide experience in [$melon#Plant*] research.
As a first objective of this project we will sequence 30,000 ESTs from eight cDNA libraries.
From these ESTs we will obtain a microarray that will be used for the study of the transcriptome.
Another main goal of the project is to increase the current genetic map resolution by mapping 300 new SNPs.
We will start a physical map and BAC contigs spanning around 1 Mb will be developed in three regions where clusters of disease resistance genes are located.
The establishment of a collection of mutants and a TILLING platform will allow us to undertake studies of reverse genetics.
Finally, we will set up a bioinformatics platform.
The information obtained will be useful at short or medium term for aspects related to the [$melon#Plant*] improvement of disease/pest resistance and fruit quality.
On the other hand, as synteny levels are expected to be high among [@Cucurbitaceae species#Plant*], these results could be applicable to other important [$cucurbits#Plant*]; such as [$cucumber#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*] or [$squash#Plant*].
