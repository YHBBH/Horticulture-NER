To find a marker gene for photoassimilate limitation in [@cucumber#Plant*] fruit, genes induced in young fruit by total defoliation were cloned using the subtraction method.
Almost every clone matched perfectly to a member of [$cucumber#Plant*] unigene ver.
3 of the [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Database.
From the clones obtained, six genes were selected and the effect of defoliation on their expression was analyzed.
In particular, expression of a gene that is highly homologous to the [$cucumber#Plant*] gene [@CsSEF1#Gene*] (CAI30889) encoding putative CCCH zinc finger protein, which is reported to be induced at somatic embryogenesis in suspension culture, was enhanced by the treatment by about 50 times.
The sequencing of the full-length cDNA and BLAST search in the [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Database indicated that our cloned gene is identical to [$CsSEF1#Gene*].
In control fruit, the expression of [$CsSEF1#Gene*] did not change markedly in terms of development.
By contrast, the expression of [$CsSEF1#Gene*] was enhanced by prolonged darkness at the transcript level.
This increase in the expression of [$CsSEF1#Gene*] was temporally correlated with the [$decline#Disease*] in the fruit respiration rate.
In mature leaves under prolonged darkness, enhanced expression was observed in the asparagine synthetase gene, but not in [$CsSEF1#Gene*].
These results suggest that the asparagine synthetase gene can be a good marker for sugar starvation and that [$CsSEF1#Gene*] might be involved in the signal transduction pathway from photoassimilate limitation to growth cessation in [$cucumber#Plant*] fruit.
