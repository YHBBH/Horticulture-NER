[@Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS)#Method*] allow for rapid development of genomics resources needed to generate molecular diagnostics assays for infectious agents.
NGS approaches are particularly helpful for organisms that cannot be cultured, such as the [$downy mildew pathogen#Virus*]s, a group of biotrophic obligate oomycetes that infect [$crops#Plant*] of economic importance.
Unlike most [$downy mildew pathogen#Virus*]s that are highly host-specific, [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*] causes disease on a broad range of [$crops#Plant*] belonging to the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
In this study, we identified candidate diagnostic markers for [$P.cubensis #Virus*]by comparing NGS data from a diverse panel of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and [$P.humuli#Virus*] isolates, two very closely related oomycete species.
[$P cubensis#Virus*] isolates from diverse hosts and geographical regions in the United States were selected for sequencing to ensure that candidates were conserved in [$P cubensis#Virus*] isolates infecting different [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts.
Genomic regions unique to and conserved in [$P cubensis#Virus*] isolates were identified through bioinformatics.
These candidate regions were then validated using [$PCR#Method*] against a larger collection of isolates from [$P cubensis#Virus*], [$P.humuli#Virus*], and other oomycetes.
Overall seven diagnostic markers were found to be specific to [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
These markers could be used for [$pathogen#Virus*] diagnostics on infected tissue, or adapted for monitoring airborne inoculum with [@real-time PCR and spore traps.#Method*]
