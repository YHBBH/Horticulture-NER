The presence of [@seed-borne viruses#Virus*] in [$winter squash#Plant*] landraces in the Black Sea region of Turkey were detected.
The seed samples of landraces were tested by [$ELISA#Method*] for [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [@Tobacco ring spot virus#Virus*] ([$TRSV#Virus*]), and [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]).
Based on the [$ELISA#Method*] results, 11.3% of the samples were [$infe#Virus*]cted with the viruses; [$ELISA#Method*], [$CMV#Virus*] was found at the rate of 5.1% in the [$winter squash#Plant*] samples, while incidence of [$ZYMV#Virus*] was determined as 6.2%.
Moreover, none of the plants germinated from seeds were found to be infected with [$SqMV#Virus*], [$TRSV#Virus*], and [$CGMMV#Virus*].
This is for the first time that [$seed-borne viruses#Virus*] of [$winter squash#Plant*] landraces have been identified in the Black Sea region of Turkey.
