 Various strains of [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) show differences in host range, pathogenicity, replication efficiency, replication of satellite RNAs, and/or efficiency of transmission by aphid vectors.
A number of these properties have been delimited to specific RNAs by re-assorting the genomic RNAs between strains (i.e.
pseudorecombination); however, until recently, delimitation of the above properties to specific nucleotides was not possible.
We have been using a combination of pseudorecombination and recombination of biologically active cDNA clones of viral RNAs to delimit and/or localize various biological properties associated with particular strains of [$CMV#Virus*].
Thus, we have determined that 1) rapid and severe symptom induction in [$zucchini squash#Plant*] by the Fny-strain of [$CMV#Virus*] map to the 5' half of RNA 1, as does the ability to replicate in some [$melon cultivars#Plant*] at 37-degrees-C; 2) the poor replication of satellite RNAs by the Sny-strain of [$CMV#Virus*] maps to RNA 1; 3) satellite RNA-mediated chlorosis-induction in [$tobacco#Plant*] is strain-specific and maps to RNA 2 of subgroup 11 [$CMV#Virus*] strains; and 4) the induction of systemic chlorosis in [$tobacco#Plant*], the cultivar-specific resistance in [$zucchini squash#Plant*], and the loss of aphid-transmissibility associated with the M-strain of [$CMV#Virus*] all map to the [$coat protein gene#Gene*] of RNA 3.
By a combination of [$sequence analysis#Method*], recombination.
and site-directed mutagenesis of cDNA clones of satellite RNAs, we have determined that 1) the induction of necrosis in [$tomato#Plant*] by some satellite RNAs is associated with the conservation of particular sequences in a domain of approximately 25 nucleotides within the 3'-half of the satellite RNAs; 2) the induction of chlorosis in either [$tobacco#Plant*] or [$tomato#Plant*] by some satellite RNAs is associated with a domain delimited to 45 nucleotides within the 5'-half of the satellite RNAs; 3) the host specificity for chlorosis, i.e.
either [$tobacco#Plant*] or [$tomato#Plant*], is determined by a single nucleotide change within this chlorosis-induction domain; and 4) the level of replication of satellite RNAs in [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts is influenced by specific sequences within the 3'-half of satellite RNAs.
These studies are the first step in determining the role of host components in various aspects of viral replication, nonhost resistance, and viral-induced pathogenicity.
