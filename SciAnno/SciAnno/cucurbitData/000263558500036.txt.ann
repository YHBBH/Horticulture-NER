[@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], or [$cucurbit family#Plant*], are important [$crops#Plant*] widely distributed in the warmest areas of the world supplying humans with edible products and useful fibres.
[$Melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) is considered the most diversified species in the [$genus Cucumis#Plant*].
The inodorus [$melon#Plant*] varieties, commonly known as "winter [$melons#Plant*]" for their capability to be preserved during the winter time, are traditionally Cultivated In the Mediterranean area and they have a relevant importance in the economy of the Italian Southern regions.
The genetic diversity and relationships among 13 Italian inodorus accessions of different geographic origin were revealed by [@using 90 ISSR primers and 18 SSR primer pairs#Method*].
The DH line Nad-1 and the Charentais-T genotype, both belonging to the botanical variety cantalupensis, were used as outgroup.
Out of 90 primers ISSR used, 39 resulted polymorphic among the landraces revealing a total of 358 polymorphic bands.
The molecular data were used to calculate the genetic distance (GD) by means of Nei and Li index.
The [$Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the GD matrix#Method*] was used to show multiple dimensions (2D) of each group of the accessions.
The cophenetic correlation coefficient of the [$Cluster analysis#Method*] is 0.92.
The UPGMA dendrogram grouped the inodorus accessions on the basis of their skin color and geographic origin.
The [@preliminary SSR analysis#Method*] revealed a high level of polymorphism thus confirming the usefulness of these [$molecular markers#Method*] to study the genetic relationship among the Italian inodorus populations.
