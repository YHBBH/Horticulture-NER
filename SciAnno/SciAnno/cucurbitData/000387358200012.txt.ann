The host range of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], the causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], includes many taxa of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
Little is known of the interactions of this [$pathogen#Virus*] with wild and [$weed#Plant*]y[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] species, the genus encompassing two important [$crops#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*].
Interactions of 97 [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
accessions, mostly wild and [$weed#Plant*]y forms representing 10 species, with 11 [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates originating from [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] were studied by using a leaf-disc method under controlled conditions.
Among the 97 accessions, 57 distinct reaction patterns were observed.
Fifteen accessions were resistant and 12 susceptible to all 11 [$pathogen#Virus*] isolates.
Within-accession, heterogeneous reactions were observed in only nine interactions.
Of the 15 accessions resistant to all pathotypes, 13 were wild and weedy [@C.argyrosperma#Plant*].
Reactions of [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
to [$P.cubensis #Virus*]are race-specific.
The development of methodology for [$P.cubensis #Virus*]race determination and denomination should include a differential set of genotypes for each species separately.
[$C.argyrosperma#Plant*], which is partially cross-compatible with the economically important [$C.pepo#Plant*], offers a potential source for breeding [$downy mildew#Virus*]-resistant [$squash #Plant*]and [$pumpkins#Plant*].
