[@Cucurbit crops#Plant*] are subject to severe losses due to several potyviruses including the highly aggressive [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
We sought to examine potyvirus/host interactions resulting in successful resistance or infection, and to test the role of the variable amino terminus (NT) of the [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) in the infection process.
Analysis of patterns of virus accumulation in the [$ZYMV#Virus*]-resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) genotype Dina-1 indicated that expression of resistance is developmentally controlled and is due to a block in virus movement.
After initial replication and movement out of the cotyledon, virus remains localized to the immediate area surrounding class III veins.
Switches of [$CP#Gene*] domains, with an infectious done ([$ZYMV#Virus*]-NAA) that does not cause veinal chlorosis, indicated that the resistance response likely involves interaction with the [$CP#Gene*]-NT.
Switches of the [$CP#Gene*]-NT with other potyviruses indicated, that despite extensive variability, the heterologous [$CP#Gene*]-NTs could facilitate systemic infection in [$ZYMV#Virus*] hosts, but did not extend host range to non-hosts.
Following initial infection susceptible [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) or [$cucumber#Plant*] plants infected with [$tobacco#Plant*] etch [@virus-ZYMV#Virus*] hybrids exhibited a distinct recovery phenotype of reduced symptoms, virus titer, and virus-specific protection against secondary infection, suggesting that recognition of the non-adapted [$CP#Gene*]-NT leads to initiation of host defense responses.
