Seed transmission of [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) has been demonstrated in a variety of [$cucurbits#Plant*], including wild[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] species, and pollen transmission of viruses is common in the [$family Potyviridae#Virus*].
Consequently, vertical transmission of [$ZYMV#Virus*] may occur via the pollen of infected wild [$squash #Plant*]as opposed to ovule transmission.
To determine if vertical infection of [$ZYMV#Virus*] occurs via pollen transmission, we pollinated flowers on virus-free [@Cucurbita pepo ssp.texana#Plant*] plants with pollen from [$ZYMV#Virus*] infected plants.
We found that seed infection of [$ZYMV#Virus*] via pollen occurs at a rate of 0.13 %.
This rate is much lower than expected based on previously reported rates of seed transmission, which suggests that while seed transmission via pollen does occur in [$C.pepo#Plant*], it is not the main mechanism for vertical infection.
Because seed transmission of [$ZYMV#Virus*] has been shown in virus-resistant [$transgenic plants#Plant*], it is possible that [$ZYMV#Virus*] infection of [$transgenic plants#Plant*] via pollen may contribute to the seed transmission and geographic distribution of this virus.
