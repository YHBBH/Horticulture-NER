The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) fingerprinting of some selected [$cucurbits#Plant*] was performed on three types of [$seed extracts#Plant*] (alcoholic, cold-water, and hot-water) in order to elaborate a characteristic FTIR profile of their family representatives and to determine their biochemical content.
[$Cluster analysis#Method*] and [@principal component analysis#Method*] were performed on [@Cucumis melo subsp.melo var.inodorus#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*], [@C.pepo var.cylindrica#Plant*], [@C.maxima subsp.maxima convar.maxima#Plant*] 'Hokkaido' to determine the similarities between their [$seed extracts#Plant*].
The ethanol extract of the [$C.pepo#Plant*] seeds was different from the other [$seed extracts#Plant*] because in addition to esters, it contained free fatty acids, which could influence its pharmacological activity.
The main variable differentiating the extracts was the absorption band at 2,920-2,925 cm(-1), which represented saturated fatty acids.
The obtained results were analyzed by various statistical tools to evaluate the fingerprints of the selected species of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
