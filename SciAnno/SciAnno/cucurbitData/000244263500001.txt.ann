Despite the importance of field-grown [@cucurbits#Plant*] in Spain, only limited information is available about the impact of disease on their production.
During the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons, systematic surveys were carried out in open field [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) [$crops#Plant*] of Murcia Province (Spain).
The fields were chosen with no previous information regarding their sanitation status, and samples were taken from plants showing viruslike symptoms.
Samples were analyzed using molecular hybridization to detect [$Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]), [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]), [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), [@Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
We collected 924 samples from 48 field plots.
Out of these, almost 90% were infected by at least one of the viruses considered, usually [$CABYV#Virus*], which was present in 83 and 66% of the [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]samples, respectively.
In the case of [$melon#Plant*], [$CYSDV#Virus*], [$BPYV#Virus*], and [$WMV#Virus*] followed [$CABYV#Virus*] in relative importance, with frequencies of around 20 to 30%, while in [$squash#Plant*], [$CVYV#Virus*] and [@BPYY#Virus*] showed frequencies between 28 and 21%.
The number of multiple infections was very high, 66 and 56% of the infected samples of [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*], respectively, being afflicted.
[$CABYV#Virus*] was present in all multiple infections.
The high incidence of [$CABYV#Virus*] in single and multiple infections suggests that this virus may well become an important threat for [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in the region.
[@Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis#Method*] revealed that [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates can be grouped into two genetic types, both of which seemed to be present during the 2003 epidemic episode, but only one of the types was found in 2004.
