Complete genome sequences of 22 isolates of [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), collected from [$melon plants#Plant*] showing yellowing symptom in Korea during the years 2013-2014, were determined and compared with previously reported [$CABYV#Virus*] genome sequences.
The complete genomes were found to be 5,680-5,684 nucleotides in length and to encode six open reading frames (ORFs) that are separated into two regions by a non-coding internal region (IR) of 199 nucleotides.
Their genomic organization is typical of the [$genus Polerovirus#Virus*].
Based on [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of complete nucleotide (nt) sequences, [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates were divided into four groups: Asian, Mediterranean, Taiwanese, and R groups.
The Korean [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates clustered with the Asian group with > 94% nt sequence identity.
In contrast, the Korean [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates shared 87-89% sequence identities with the Mediterranean group, 88% with the Taiwanese group, 81-84% with the [$CABYV-R#Virus*] group, and 72% with another polerovirus, M..
Recombination analyses identified 24 recombination events (12 different recombination types) in the analyzed [$CABYV#Virus*] population.
In the Korean [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates, four recombination types were detected from eight isolates.
Two recombination types were detected in the IR and P3-P5 regions, respectively, which have been reported as hotspots for recombination of [$CABYV#Virus*].
This result suggests that recombination is an important evolutionary force in the genetic diversification of [$CABYV#Virus*] populations.
