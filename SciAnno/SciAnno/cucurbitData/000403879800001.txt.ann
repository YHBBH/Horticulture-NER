[@Bitter gourd#Plant*] ([$Momordica charantia#Plant*]) is widely cultivated as a [$vegetable#Plant*] and medicinal herb in many Asian and African countries.
After the sequencing of the [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]), and [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) genomes, [$bitter gourd#Plant*] became the fourth [$cucurbit species #Plant*]whose whole genome was sequenced.
However, a [@comprehensive analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSRs)#Method*] in [$bitter gourd#Plant*], including a comparison with the three aforementioned [$cucurbit species #Plant*]has not yet been published.
Here, we identified a total of 188,091 and 167,160 SSR motifs in the genomes of the [$bitter gourd#Plant*] lines 'Dali-11' and 'OHB3-1,' respectively.
Subsequently, the SSR content, motif lengths, and classified motif types were characterized for the [$bitter gourd#Plant*] genomes and compared among all the [$cucurbit #Plant*]genomes.
Lastly, a large set of 138,727 unique in silico SSR primer pairs were designed for [$bitter gourd#Plant*].
Among these, 71 primers were selected, all of which successfully amplified SSRs from the two [$bitter gourd#Plant*] lines 'Dali-11' and 'K44'.
To further examine the utilization of unique SSR primers, 21 [$SSR markers#Method*] were used to genotype a collection of 211 [$bitter gourd#Plant*] lines from all over the world.
A model-based clustering method and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] indicated a clear separation among the geographic groups.
The genomic [$SSR markers#Method*] developed in this study have considerable potential value in advancing [$bitter gourd#Plant*] research.
