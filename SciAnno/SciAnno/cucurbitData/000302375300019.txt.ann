[@Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] ([@FOM#Virus*]) is the cause of [@vascular wilting of melon#Disease*], the most severe infectious disease of this [$cucurbit#Plant*].
Four races (0, 1, 2, and 1,2) of [$FOM#Virus*] have been identified all of which occur in Italy.
A [@PCR assay based on race-specific SCAR markers#Method*] for [$FOM#Virus*] race 2 identification was developed which proved specific, sensitive, and reliable, regardless of the origin of isolates.
SCAR primers developed from [$RAPD markers#Method*] were able to identify unambiguously [$FOM#Virus*] race 2, that causes symptoms similar to those elicited by the other [$FOM#Virus*] races.
These are morphologically indistinguishable from one another and from the other formae speciales of the same [$fungus#Virus*].
The specificity of these primers, which did not amplify the most common [$melon#Plant*] [$pathogens#Virus*], makes them a reliable tool for diagnosis.
This finding may have additional practical applications in the epidemiology and management of [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] of [$melon#Plant*] caused by this race in areas where the disease is widespread.
