[@Powdery mildew#Disease*] has become a regular and serious problem on [$sunflower#Plant*] in India during the past decade.
[$Powdery mildew#Disease*] infected leaves were collected from ten regions in seven major [$sunflower#Plant*] growing states of India representing kharif, rabi and spring cultivation.
Anamorph characteristics were studied to identify the [$pathogen#Virus*].
Five isolates from each of the location were subjected to [$molecular analysis#Method*] using universal primers specific to Erysiphales and the ITS primers specific to three species of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$Golovinomyces orontii#Virus*], [@Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*], [$Leveillula taurica#Virus*]) reported to infect [$sunflower#Plant*].
Further, the [$pathogen#Virus*] infecting [$weeds#Plant*] in [$sunflower#Plant*] fields, [$cucumber crops#Plant*] grown in the vicinity of [$sunflower#Plant*] fields and perpetuating on two wild [@Helianthus#Plant*] species ([@H.strumosus#Plant*], [@H.hirsutus#Plant*]) for 7 years was characterized.
Morphological, molecular and [$sequence analysis#Method*] confirmed the fungi infecting [$sunflower#Plant*] including the wild species as [$G.orontii#Virus*].
Members of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae were infected by [@P.xanthii#Virus*] with the exception of [$Coccinia#Plant*] sps and [$Luffa acutangula#Plant*] which showed infection of [$G.orontii#Virus*].
Common [$beans#Plant*], [@Zinnia elegans#Plant*] and [@Euphorbia hirta#Plant*] revealed infection of [$G.orontii#Virus*] while other [$crops#Plant*] showed infection of [@P.xanthii#Virus*].
None of the[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] samples showed infection of [$Leveillula taurica#Virus*].
[$Blast#Disease*] analysis of the ITS sequences and characteristics of the anamorphs were mostly in agreement with the respective [$pathogen#Virus*] except for E.hirta which were dimorphic, large and paramoecium shaped.
Cross infectivity studies of the [$pathogen#Virus*] isolated from [$cucurbits#Plant*] and sprayed on [$sunflower#Plant*] failed to infect while those from wild [$sunflower#Plant*]s and [@Z.elegans#Plant*] caused [$infe#Plant*]ction.
