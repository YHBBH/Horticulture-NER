Two hundred sixty-six [@Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Matsum.& Nakai#Plant*] accessions (Plant Introductions and named cultivars) were tested against a race 2 [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*] ([@Schlechtend.: Fr.#Virus*]) Pollacci isolate to evaluate for resistance to [@powdery mildew disease#Disease*].
Growth room-grown [$seedlings#Plant*] were artificially inoculated with.
[$conidia#Virus*] from [$watermelon#Plant*] host leaves at 2-day intervals from the appearance of the first true leaf until test results data were taken, when the second true leaf was fully expanded.
Plants were evaluated on a 1 to 9 scale of increasing disease severity.
Disease indices (DIs) were calculated as weighted averages for each entry.
All genotypes with resistant plants ([$powdery mildew#Disease*] rating 1 to 3) were reevaluated in a replicated test of 3 replications of 10 plants each.
Disease indices were again calculated.
Twenty-two plant introductions (PIs) and one named variety displayed intermediate resistance to [$powdery mildew#Disease*] in the replicated test with DIs ranging from 5.0 to 6.0.
