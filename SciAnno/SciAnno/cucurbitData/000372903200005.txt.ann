Key message A dominantly inherited major-effect QTL for[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*] was fine mapped.
Two tandemly arrayed cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase genes were identified as the most possible candidates.
   [$Powdery mildew#Disease*] (PM) is one of the most severe fungal diseases of [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]) and other [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], but the mo[$lecul#Virus*]ar genetic mechanisms of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] resistance in [$cucurbits#Plant*] are still poorly understood.
In this study, through marker-assisted backcrossing with an elite [$cucumber#Plant*] inbred line, D8 (PM susceptible), we developed a single-segment substitution line, SSSL0.7, carrying 95 kb fragment from PM resistance donor, Jin5-508, that was defined by two [$microsatellite markers#Method*], SSR16472 and SSR16881.
A segregating population with 3600 F-2 plants was developed from the SSSL0.7 x D8 mating; [@segregation analysis#Method*] confirmed a dominantly inherited major-effect QTL, Pm1.1 in [$cucumber#Plant*] chromosome 1 underlying PM resistance in SSSL0.7.
New [$molecular markers#Method*] were developed through exploring the next generation resequenced genomes of Jin5-508 and D8.
Linkage analysis and QTL mapping in a subset of the F-2 plants delimited the Pm1.1 locus into a 41.1 kb region, in which eight genes were predicted.
Comparative gene expression analysis revealed that two concatenated genes, Csa1M064780 and Csa1M064790 encoding the same function of a cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase, were the most likely candidate genes.
[@GFP fusion protein-aided subcellular localization#Method*] indicated that both candidate genes were located in the plasma membrane, but Csa1M064780 was also found in the nucleus.
This is the first report of dominantly inherited PM resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*].
Results of this study will provide new insights into understanding the phenotypic and genetic mechanisms of PM resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*].
This work should also facilitate marker-assisted selection in [$cucumber#Plant*] breeding for PM resistance.
