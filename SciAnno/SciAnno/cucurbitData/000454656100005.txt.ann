The sequence encoding hDNase I with its native N-terminal signal peptide was codon-optimized for heterological expression in [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
The obtained synthetic[@ gene#Method*] [@rhDN#Gene*] was successfully transiently expressed in [$L.cylindrica#Plant*] ([@luffa#Plant*]) leaves using agroinfiltration.
The results of in silico analysis suggest that the [$rhDN#Gene*][$ gene#Method*] can be expressed in different [$cucurbits#Plant*] and in non-[$cucurbit species#Plant*], such as a model plant [$Nicotiana tabacum#Plant*].
For further analysis of the recombinant hDNase I ([$rhDN#Gene*]ase I) produced in planta we[$ gene#Method*]rated stably transformed [$tobacco#Plant*] lines (NtDN) overexpressing the [$rhDN#Gene*][$ gene#Method*].
The presence of the active [$rhDN#Gene*]ase I in the total protein extracts and in the intercellular fluids isolated from the leaves of the transgenic NtDN lines was demonstrated.
However, the plants producing the [$rhDN#Gene*]ase I did not show any visible changes in the phenotype.
Using indirect immunofluorescence, we localized the [$rhDN#Gene*]ase I in the intercellular space of NtDN leaves, which suggests that the native hDNase I signal peptide can be correctly recognized in the plant cells, what results in the protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum and then to the secretory pathway.
Our results indicate the possibility to use the human DNase I as a molecular tool for improving and optimization of the plant expression systems based on [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Additionally, the established [$tobacco#Plant*] lines overexpressing the [$rhDN#Gene*][$ gene#Method*] can be used as a platform to produce the active human DNase I.
