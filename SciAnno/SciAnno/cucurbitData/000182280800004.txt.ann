We developed 31 sets of [@melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) [@microsatellite markers#Method*] in this study.
Primers for these markers were designed from clones containing simple sequence re[$pea#Plant*]ts (SSRs) of (GA/CT)n or (GT/CA)n isolated from a [$melon#Plant*] genomic library.
These microsatellite loci were examined for the detection of alleles among twelve lines and cultivars from six varieties of [@C.melo#Plant*].
A total of 28 marker loci showed polymorphism by [@2.0% agarose TBE gel separation#Method*].
And these markers were also examined for cross-species amplification applicable to nine other species in[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae.
Among them, 13 marker loci were commonly detected within the major [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] using the present primer sets.
The species to which the [$melon#Plant*] [$microsatellite markers#Method*] would be most applicable was [$Momordica charantia#Plant*] (24 markers), followed by [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] (20 markers) and [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] (18 markers).
These conserved microsatellite loci could be used as anchor markers in studies on synteny in [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
