Phloem-specific proteins (P proteins) are particularly useful markers to investigate long-distance trafficking of macromolecules in plants.
In this study, genus-specific molecular probes were used in combination with intergeneric grafts to reveal the presence of a pool of translocatable P protein subunits.
[@Immunoblot analyses#Method*] demonstrated that [$Cucurbits#Plant*] spp P proteins [$PP1 #Gene*]and [$PP2#Gene*] are translocated from [$Cucurbita#Plant*] maxims stocks and accumulate in [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] scions.
[$Cucurbita#Plant*] maxims or [$Cucurbita#Plant*] ficifolia [$PP1 #Gene*]and [$PP2#Gene*] mRNAs were not detected in [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] scions by either [@RNA gel blot analysis#Method*] or [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*], indicating that the proteins, rather than transcripts, are translocated.
Tissue prints of the [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] scion, using antibodies raised against [$Cucurbita#Plant*] maxims [$PP1 #Gene*]or [$PP2#Gene*], detected both proteins in the fascicular phloem of the stem at points distal to the graft union and in the petiole of a developing leaf, suggesting that the proteins move within the assimilate stream toward sink tissues.
[$Cucurbita#Plant*] maxims [$PP1 #Gene*]was immunolocalized by light microscopy in sieve elements of the extrafascicular phloem of [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] [$scions#Plant*], whereas [$Cucurbita#Plant*] maxims [$PP2#Gene*] was detected in both sieve elements and companion cells.
