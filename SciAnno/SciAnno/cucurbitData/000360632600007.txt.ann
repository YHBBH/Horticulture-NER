BACKGROUND[@Cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] caused by [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]limits [$crop#Plant*] production in Spain, where disease control is largely dependent on fungicides.
In previous studies, high levels of resistance to QoI and DMI fungicides were documented in south-central Spain.
The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] populations to other fungicides and to provide tools for improved disease management.
   RESULTSUsing a leaf-disc assay, sensitivity to thiophanate-methyl, bupirimate and quinoxyfen of 50 isolates of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] was analysed to determine discriminatory concentrations between sensitive and resistant isolates.
With the exception of thiophanate-methyl, no clearly different groups of isolates could be identified, and as a result, discriminatory concentrations were established on the basis of the maximum fungicide field application rate.
Subsequently, a survey of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] resistance to these fungicides was carried out by testing a collection of 237 isolates obtained during the 2002-2011 [$cucurbit #Plant*]growing seasons.
This analysis revealed very high levels of resistance to thiophanate-methyl (95%).
By contrast, no resistance to bupirimate and quinoxyfen was found.
   CONCLUSIONResults suggest that thiophanate-methyl has become completely ineffective for controlling [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] in Spain.
By contrast, bupirimate and quinoxyfen remain as very effective tools for [@cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] management.
