[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) emerged as a new [$pathogen#Virus*] on fall [$melons#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) in the western U.S.
and Mexico in 2006, recurred in 2007, and is now firmly established in the region.
Replicated, naturally infected field tests of genetically diverse [$melon#Plant*] cultigens were evaluated for resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] in Imperial Valley, Calif.
and Yuma, Ariz.
in 2006 and 2007.
[$Melon#Plant*] Plant Introduction (PI) 3 13970 expressed high-level resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] at both locations in both years.
Three sources of TGR-1551 ( PI 482420) exhibited high-level resistance to the California strain of [$CYSDV#Virus*] in 2007.
Three of 96 accessions from India are potential sources of unique resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*]: Ames 20203, PI 614185, and PI 614213 each had one individual plant with mild symptoms despite their infestation by high numbers of the vector, [@sweet potato whitefly biotype-B#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] Genn.).
Resistant and susceptible plants were positive for presence of [$CYSDV#Virus*] using [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) and nucleic acid hybridization.
None of the accessions evaluated expressed immune type resistance.
