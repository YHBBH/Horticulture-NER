 Field trials were carried out in northeastern Uttar Pradesh (India) to determine the effectiveness of the aphid parasitoid Trioxys indicus Subba Rao & Sharma against the [@cucurbit aphid Aphid gossypii Glover#Virus*] on [@Lagenaria vulgaris#Plant*] ([$bottle gourd#Plant*]), [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] ([@ghia torai#Plant*]) and [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] ([$pumpkin#Plant*]).
Two initial inoculative releases of the parasitoid with the rate of 10 mummies/m(2) during the first and third weeks of December decreased the population growth of the aphid on L.vulgaris and [$L.cylindrica#Plant*].
A 20 to 50% reduction of the [$aphd#Virus*] number was noticed within 15 days after the first release in the fields on the two [$crops#Plant*].
The second release of the parasitoid further reduced the population by up to 65-70%.
The rate of parasitism in natural conditions (control fields) and in experimental fields (where the parasitoids were released) was found to be density-dependent except in the fields of [$C.maxima#Plant*].
The results demonstrated the potential of T.indicus against [$A.gossypii#Virus*] in a [@cucurbit habitat#Plant*].
