[@Cucurbits#Plant*] have great economic, nutritional and social importance in the Brazilian semiarid region.
In this region, many factors can result in reduced productivity of these [$crops#Plant*], especially fungal and viral diseases.
Therefore, knowledge of [$cucurbits#Plant*] is crucial for proper disease management.
The objective of this work was to identify the major diseases of [$cucurbits#Plant*] grown in some municipalities in the Hinterland of the state of Pernambuco.
Thus, plant samples were collected with symptoms in [$crops#Plant*] in the municipalities of Salgueiro, Serra Talhada, Floresta, Petrolandia, Ibimirim, Custodia and Inaja.
A questionnaire was also applied to gather information about the production profile of producers.
Seven [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]cting [$cucurbits#Plant*] were identified: [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*], [@Colletotrichum sp.#Virus*], [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*], [$Rhizoctonia solani#Virus*], [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*], [@Fusarium sp.e Alternaria sp.#Virus*], and three viruses as well: [@Papaya ringspot virus - watermelon strain#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
It was found that in small [$crops#Plant*], there is limited search for technical information om [$crop#Plant*]ping, and these [$crops#Plant*] originate mostly from native seeds, in contrast to medium and large producers, who use improved cultivars.
The [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] are the most commercially exploited, while [$pumpkins#Plant*] are used in subsistence agriculture.
As for plant health problems, most respondents reported knowing the main diseases that occur in [$crops#Plant*] and perform disease control based on personal experience and / or through the help of the technical assistance provided by agricultural stores.
In a few cases, in large farms, there was an agronomist to assist in this type of control.
