Northeast India is known for its diverse nature of soil, climate, and topography.
This region is rich in diversity of many fruits, [@vegetables#Plant*], flowers particularly [$orchids#Plant*], [$spices#Plant*], [@bamboo#Plant*] and [@medicinal & aromatic plants#Plant*].
Among the commercial fruits of the country, maximum diversity in [$citrus#Plant*], [@banana#Plant*] and [@jack fruit#Plant*] are found in Northeast India.
A large number of diversity in other [$tropical and subtropical fruits#Plant*] belonging to the genera [@Garcinia#Plant*], [@Artocarpus#Plant*], [@Phyllanthus#Plant*], [@Annona#Plant*], [@Averrhoa#Plant*], [@Persia#Plant*],[@ Aegle#Plant*], [@Passiflora#Plant*] and [@Tamarindus#Plant*] etc.
are reported from the region.
Northeast India is also rich in different genotypes of [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$solanaceous #Plant*][$vegetables#Plant*], [$ginger#Plant*], [$turmeric#Plant*], [$bamboo#Plant*], [$leafy vegetables#Plant*] etc.
Among the different ornamental [$horticultural crops#Plant*], the region has the maximum diversity in [$orchids#Plant*], [@fern#Plant*] and other [@flowering shrubs#Plant*].
Indigenous and minor [$horticultural crops#Plant*] available in the region are however not being exploited properly.
These [$crops#Plant*] have the potentiality to alleviate the poverty, food and nutritional insecurity through processing and value addiltion.
Most of these [$crops#Plant*] are rich in vitamins, minerals and such other bioactive molecules suitable for medicine, aromatic and food processing industries.
Protocols for preparation of instant ginger candy; minimally processed ready-to-cook jack fruit; jam-jelly, fermented and non fermented beverages from different indigenous fruits and tuity fruity from chow-chow have already [$bean#Plant*] standardized.
These value added products if produced commercially will go a long way in increasing the area under these [$crops#Plant*] and thereby enhancing farm income and nutritional security of the farmers.
