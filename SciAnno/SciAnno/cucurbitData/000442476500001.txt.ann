[@Zucchini#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), which belongs to the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], is a[$ summer squash#Plant*] widely cultivated in Morocco.
Viral infections are destructive to [$cucurbits#Plant*], often rendering the fruit produced unmarketable.
In April 2017, during a field survey for [$zucchini#Plant*] viruses in Gharb region (western Morocco), a total of 10 leaf samples of variety 'Bajaty' were collected from plants showing virus-like symptoms and were processed for laboratory analyses.
Commercial available [$ELISA#Method*] kits were used to test for the presence of [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) and [@cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]).
Results showed that all the tested samples were positive to [$ZYMV#Virus*], three were positive to [$SqMV#Virus*] and two were positive to [$CABYV#Virus*].
To confirm the presence of [$CABYV#Virus*], total RNA extracts were obtained from all the 10 samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and tested by [$reverse transcription (RT)-PCR#Method*] with two sets of primers: CE9 (5'-GAATACGGTCGCGGCTAGAAATC-3') and C[$E1#Virus*]0 (5'-CTAT TTCGGGTTCTGGACCTGGC-3') that amplify the complete (600 bp) [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene (Juarez et al.
in Plant Dis 88:907, 2004) and [$CABYV#Virus*]Up (5'-GTCCGAAACCGCCTGACGC-3') and [$CABYV#Virus*]Do (5'-TCGAGGTTCGAGCA AGCTG-3') that amplify a partial fragment (294 bp) within the [$RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene#Gene*] (Lotos et al.
in J Vir Methods 198:1-11, 2014).
Amplicons of the expected sizes using both sets of primers were obtained from the two samples positive for [$CABYV#Virus*] by [$ELISA#Method*], thus confirming the presence of [$CABYV#Virus*].
[$PCR#Method*] products of the [$CP#Gene*] gene from one positive sample were purified and sequenced in both directions.
Obtained sequence (MH414922) showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with the isolate Rak-1 (HM771271) from the Czech Republic.
Even though [$CABYV#Virus*] ap[$pears#Plant*] to be widespread throughout the Mediterranean Basin (Lecoq et al.
in Plant Pathol 41:749-761, 1992; Abou-Jawdah et al.
in Plant Dis 81:1331, 1997, Crop Prot 19:217-224, 2000; Juarez et al.
in Plant Dis 88:907, 2004; Hattab et al.
in Plant Dis 89:776, 2005; Tamassoli and Meneghini in Plant Pathol 56:720, 2007; Yardimci and Ozgonen in Australas Plant Dis Notes 2:59, 2007; Omar and Bagdady in Phytoparasitica 40:177-184, 2012), to our knowledge, it has not previously been described in Morocco.
[$CABYV#Virus*] is transmitted in a persistent manner by severalaphid species; therefore, effective control of aphid vectors is of utmost importance for [$CABYV#Virus*] management in [$zucchini#Plant*] as well as in other [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
