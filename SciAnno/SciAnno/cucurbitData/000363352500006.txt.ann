[@Linnaeosicyos amara#Plant*] is a little known [$cucurbit #Plant*]endemic to the [$Caribbean#Plant*] island of Hispaniola.
The species possesses conspicuously fringed petals which are known in just four other [$cucurbit #Plant*]genera and hypothesised to play a role in pollinator attraction.
A population of flowering [@L amara#Plant*] plants was observed for a total of 78 h, which revealed that Sphingid moths are the primary pollinators.
Floral scent was dominated by the terpenoid (E)-beta-ocimene.
The elaborate petal fringes almost doubled the apparent diameter of [@L.amara#Plant*] flowers and the maximal extension of petal fringes was found to coincide with the peak visitation period of hawk-moths, with withering starting soon after.
We conclude that petal fringes likely play a role in the visual attraction of hawk-moths by exploiting their preference for large flowers with deeply-divided petal margins, whilst limiting energy costs to the plant.
