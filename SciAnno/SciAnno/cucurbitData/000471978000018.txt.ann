[@Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), [$genus Tobamovirus#Virus*], is a major [$pathogen#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] that primarily affects [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
The aim of this study was to reveal the contribution of [$CGMMV#Virus*]-[$infe#Plant*]cted female flowers to disease spread.
Using a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, we show that ovaries and ovules of [$CGMMV#Virus*]-infected [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon plants#Plant*] showed a [$CGMMV#Virus*]-specific fluorescence signal prior to and following anthesis.
The fluorescence signal was prominent but sporadic.
Ripe fruits of infected [$melon plants#Plant*] showed strong signals in the funiculus, the seed stalk, which connects the developing seed to the interior ovary wall.
Importantly, in seeds, a strong fluorescence signal was observed in the perisperm-endosperm (PE) envelope, which underlies the seed coat and surrounds the embryo.
Interestingly, the fluorescence signal was not uniformly distributed in the PE envelope but was localized to a specific envelope layer.
These results have important epidemiological implications for [$CGMMV#Virus*] management and commercial seed production, particularly regarding the improvement of seed disinfection methods that will contribute to limit the global distribution of the virus.
