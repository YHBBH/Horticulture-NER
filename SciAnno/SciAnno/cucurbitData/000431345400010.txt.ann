In autumn 2011, a survey was conducted for the identification of plant pathogenic bacteria affecting [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] grown in southwestern Iran.
[$Squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo var.styriaca#Plant*]) plants with suspected bacterial symptoms, i.e.
necrotic spots surrounded by chlorotic haloes, were collected and brought to the laboratory for further analysis.
Two Gram-negative, red-pigmented bacterial strains were isolated from [$squash #Plant*]leaves in Shushtar county, Khuzestan province.
The isolates induced hypersensitive reaction (HR) on [$tobacco#Plant*] plants 24 h post-inoculation.
A [@pathogenicity test#Method*] on 25-day-old [$squash plant#Plant*]s yielded symptoms consisting of necrotic spots surrounded by chlorotic haloes that appeared 5-10 days post-inoculation.
The causal agent was identified as [$Serratia marcescens#Virus*] based on biochemical and [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*].
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of 16S rRNA, gyrB and groE genes sequences showed that the isolates have 99-100% similarity with [$S.marcescens#Virus*] strains previously described as [$pathogen#Virus*]ic to [$bell pepper#Plant*] and [$corn#Plant*] plants.
Although non-pigmented strains of [$S.marcescens#Virus*] have previously been described as the causal agents of [$cucurbit yellow vine disease#Disease*], this is the first report of a HR-inducing red-pigmented strain of the bacterium associated with [$squash #Plant*]leaf chlorosis and necrosis.
