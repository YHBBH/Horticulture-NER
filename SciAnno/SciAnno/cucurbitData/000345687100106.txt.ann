Although no hermaphrodite or andromonoecious genotypes have been described in[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], we have identified a number of genotypes in which female flowers are partially or completely converted into bisexual flowers when grown under high temperatures.
This unstable monoecy is associated with a reduction in ethylene production in young floral buds.
In fact, anti-ethylene treatments of the apical meristems with AVG and STS were able to induce the conversion of female into bisexual flowers in the absence of inductive conditions in all the tested genotypes, while ethylene treatments reduced the conversion of female into bisexual flowers under inductive conditions.
The inbred lines Bolognese (Bog) and Vegetable Spaghetti (Veg), contrasting for both sex expression and ethylene production and sensitivity, are both stable for monoecy.
However, the F2 populations from the cross Bog x Veg segregated in a 15:1 ratio of stable/unstable monoecy under inductive conditions, indicating that monoecy instability derived from this cross is conferred by two independent recessive genes.
The conversion of female into bisexual flowers in andromonoecious and hermaphroditic genotypes of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) is the result of a mutation in the [@CmACS7 #Gene*]or [@CsACS2#Gene*] genes, two orthologs encoding an ACC synthase ([$ACS#Gene*]) that arrest stamen development by regulating the production of ethylene in young female floral buds.
An [$ACS#Gene*] gene, having the highest similarity with [$CmACS7 #Gene*]or [$CsACS2#Gene*], has been cloned and characterised in[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
As occurs in the other two [$cucurbit species#Plant*], the gene, named [@CpACS2/7#Gene*], is only expressed in female but not in male floral buds.
The possible function of this gene in monoecy instability was studied by comparing its expression in stable and unstable genotypes of segregating population of Bog x Veg, as well as in other unstable genotypes of [$C.pepo#Plant*].
