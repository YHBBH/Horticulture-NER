A virus identified as a new pathotype of [@Papaya leaf distortion mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@PLDMV#Virus*], P-TW-WF) was isolated from diseased [$papaya#Plant*] in an isolated test-field in central Taiwan, where transgenic [$papaya#Plant*] lines resistant to [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) were evaluated.
The infected plants displayed severe mosaic, distortion and shoe-stringing on leaves; stunting in apex; and water-soaking on petioles and stems.
This virus, which did not react in [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] with the antiserum to the [$PRSV#Virus*] [$coat protein#Gene*], infected only [$papaya#Plant*], but not the other IS plant species tested.
Virions studied under electron microscope exhibited mor-phology and dimensions of [$potyvirus#Virus*] particles.
Reverse transcription-[$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] conducted [@using potyvirus-specific primers#Method*] generated a 1,927-nucleotide product corresponding to the 3' region of a [$potyvirus#Virus*], showing high sequence identity to the [$CP#Gene*] gene and 3' non-coding region of [$PLDMV#Virus*].
Search for similar isolates with the antiserum against [$CP#Gene*] of P-TW-WF revealed scattered occurrence of [$PLDMV#Virus*] in Taiwan.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of [$PLDMV#Virus*] isolates of Taiwan and Japan indicated that the Taiwan isolates belong to a separate genetic cluster.
Since all the Taiwan isolates infected only [$papaya#Plant*], unlike the [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting Japanese P type isolates, the Taiwan isolates are considered a new pathotype of [$PLDMV#Virus*].
Susceptibility of all our [$PRSV#Virus*]-resistant transgenic [$papaya#Plant*] lines to [$PLDMV#Virus*] indicates that the virus is an emerging threat for the application of [$PRSV#Virus*]-resistant transgenic [$papaya#Plant*] in Taiwan and elsewhere.
