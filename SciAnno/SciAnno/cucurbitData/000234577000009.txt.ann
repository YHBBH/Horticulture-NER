[@Powdery mildew#Disease*] is a serious disease of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) worldwide.
Twenty-two [$melon#Plant*] cultigens have been used to define 22 reported races of [@the pathogen Podosphaera xanthii (sect.Sphaerotheca) xanthii (Castag.) U.Braun & N.Shish.Comb.nov.#Virus*][[@syn.Sphaerotheca fulig inea (Schlecht.ex Fr.) Poll.#Virus*]].
Discrepancies in the reactions of eight cultigens to populations of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] races 1 and 2 in California, Japan, and Spain revealed genetic differences among them that can be used to differentiate [$P.xanthii#Virus*] race 1 and 2 populations in these countries.
Implicit in these results is the existence of previously unknown virulence factors in these populations of [$P.xanthii#Virus*] races I and 2 that permit designation of new races of [$P.xanthii#Virus*] on [$melon#Plant*].
Synthesis of these results with previous reports resulted in the identification of 28 putative races of [$P.xanthii#Virus*] on [$melon#Plant*] that include eight variants of race 1 and six variants of race 2.
Six of the cultigens exhibited resistant blisters in response to heavy infection by [$P.xanthii#Virus*] in field and greenhouse tests.
