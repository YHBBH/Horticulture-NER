The [@etiology of pallidosis#Disease*], a disease of [@strawberry#Plant*] identified more than 45 years ago, remains unknown.
We report a putative agent of the disease, a virus belonging to the [$Crinivirus genus#Virus*] of the [@Closterovirideae family#Virus*].
A sensitive [@reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test#Method*] has been developed.
Polyclonal antibodies that can be used to detect the virus in petiole tissue blots were developed using a recombinant virus [$coat protein#Gene*].
The nucleotide sequences of regions of the viral genome that encode the heat shock protein 70 homolog and the major [$coat protein#Gene*] were obtained.
Alignments of the major [$coat protein#Gene*] show that the virus isolated from [$strawberry#Plant*] plants positive for pallidosis is most closely related to [$Cucumber#Plant*] yellows virus (syn.
[@Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*]) and [@Cucurbit yellow stunt disorder virus#Virus*], members of the [$Crinivirus genus#Virus*].
