In this work, the causal agents of fungal and [@bacterial diseases in cucurbit#Disease*] plants grown in greenhouse were investigated in eleven different locations of Antalya.
Based on the [$surveys#Method*] done in different greenhouses, causal agents were determined extensively in the stages of seedling and fruiting of [@Cucurbitaceae plants#Plant*] ([$melons#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$cucumbers#Plant*], [$squashes#Plant*]).
[$Melon#Plant*]s ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) and [$watermelons#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.&Nakai#Plant*]) are eaten as fruits, whereas summer and [$winter squashes#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]) are eaten as [$vegetables#Plant*].
Fungal and [$bacterial pathogens#Virus*] of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae plants grown in the province of Antalya were determined by symptomatological, pathological and microscopic tests.
Initial symptoms of bacterial infection occurred on leaves and consist of small, irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions, they become angular in shape and delimited by leaf veins.
Leaf spots and necrotic lesions, fruit spots and lesions also occurred.
[$Damping off#Disease*] and [$root rot#Disease*]s ([$Fusarium spp#Virus*]., [$Phytophthora spp.#Virus*], [@Pythium spp.#Virus*], [$Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn#Virus*].) were determined in [$seedlings#Plant*].
[$Downy mildew #Disease*]([@Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk and Curt.) Rostow)#Virus*] and[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*]) were determined in [$melon#Plant*], [$squashes#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
Powder [$mildew#Virus*] of [$cucumber#Plant*] is very common in nearly all [$cucumber#Plant*]-growing areas.
[@Botrytis cinerea ((De Bary) Whetzel)#Virus*] and [@Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ((Lib.) De Bary)#Virus*] were determined in [$squash#Plant*].
The [$bacterial pathogens#Virus*] of [@Pseudomonas syringae pv.lachrymans ((S.&B.) Y.D.&W.#Virus*]) on [$cucumber#Plant*], [@Xanthomonas spp.#Plant*]
on [$melon#Plant*], [@Acidovorax avenae subsp.#Virus*]
citrulli on [$watermelon#Plant*].
Management practices effective for these diseases include rotation, fumigation, solarization, [$pathogen#Virus*]-free seed, treated seed, host plant resistance, sanitation, adjusting soil pH, controlling [$weeds#Plant*] and insects, and using chemical and biological fungicides and bactericides.
