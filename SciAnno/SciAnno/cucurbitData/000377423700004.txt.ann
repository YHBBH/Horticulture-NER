The main areas for field-grown [$vegetable#Plant*] production in Iran were surveyed during the years of 2012-2014 to determine the occurrence of [$begomoviruses#Virus*] infecting these [$crops#Plant*].
A total of 787 leaf samples were collected from [$vegetables#Plant*] and some other [$host plants#Plant*] showing virus-like symptoms and tested by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ([$ELISA#Method*]) using polyclonal antibodies produced against [$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([$TYLCV#Virus*]).
According to the [$ELISA#Method*] results, 81 samples (10.3%) positively reacted with the virus antibodies.
[$Begomovirus#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]ctions were confirmed by [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) using previously described [$TYLCV#Virus*]-specific primer pair [$TYLCV#Virus*]-Sari [$TYLCV#Virus*]-Isr or universal primer pair Begomo-F/Begomo-R.
The [$PCR tests#Method*] using the primer pair [$TYLCV#Virus*]-Sar/[$TYLCV#Virus*]-Isr resulted in the amplification of the expected fragments of ca.
0.67-kb in size for [$ELISA#Method*]-positive samples tested from [$alfalfa#Plant*], [$pepper#Plant*], [$spinach#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] plants, confirming the presence of [$TYLCV#Virus*].
For one [$melon#Plant*] sample, having a week reaction in [$ELISA#Method*] and no reaction in [$PCR#Method*] using [$TYLCV#Virus*]-specific primers, the [$PCR#Method*] reaction using the primer pair Begomo-F/Begomo-R resulted in the amplification fragments of the expected size of ca.
2.8 kb.
The nucleotide sequences of the DNA amplicons derived from the isolate, Kz-Me198, were determined and compared with other sequences available in GenBank.
BLASTN analysis confirmed the [$begomovirus#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]ction of the sample and showed 99% identities with [$Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus#Virus*] ([$ToLCNDV#Virus*]); [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] supported the results of the database searches.
This study reports the natural occurrence of [$TYLCV#Virus*] in different hosts in Iran.
Our results also reveal the emergence of [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] in Iranian [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
