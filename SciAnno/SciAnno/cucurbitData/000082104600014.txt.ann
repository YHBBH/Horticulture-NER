Field studies were conducted near Tifton, GA, from 1995 to 1997 to measure[@ Cyperus esculentus#Plant*] ([@yellow nutsedge#Plant*]) interference with 'Fancipack' [$Cucumis sativus (cucumber)#Plant*] [@using a response prediction experiment#Method*] with a natural infestation of [@C.esculentus#Plant*].
[$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] was direct-seeded each year.
Plots (1.8 by 1.8 m) were established immediately after [$crop#Plant*] emergence.
[@Cyperus esculentus#Plant*] plants were counted 2 wk after [$crop#Plant*] emergence in each plot, at which time four [$weed#Plant*]-free plots were randomly established.
[$C.esculentus#Plant*] densities ranged from 0 to 955 plants m(-2).
Total yield, plant biomass, and [$C.sativus#Plant*] stand were regressed against [$C.esculentus#Plant*] density and biomass.
Regression analysis showed a 5% reduction in [$C.sativus#Plant*] yield with a [$C.esculentus#Plant*] infestation of approximately 15 plants m(-2).
A uniform [$C.sativus#Plant*] stand maximized its competitive ability and minimized interference from [$C.esculentus#Plant*].
[$Cyperus esculentus#Plant*] was more competitive and reduced [$C.sativus#Plant*] yields when [$C.sativus#Plant*] stands were low and nonuniform.
