[@Bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits (BFB)#Disease*] is caused by the gram-negative bacterium [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], whose populations can be distinguished into two genetically distinct groups, I and II.
Based on visual assessment of [$BFB#Disease*] severity on [$cucurbit #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*] and fruit after inoculation under greenhouse conditions, group I [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains have been reported to be moderately to highly virulent on several [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts, whereas group II strains have exhibited high virulence on [$watermelon#Plant*] but low virulence on other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Additionally, group I strains are recovered from a range of [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts, while group II strains are predominantly found on [$watermelon#Plant*].
The goal of this research was to develop tools to characterize and rapidly distinguish group I and II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains.
We first sought to determine whether quantification of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]colonization of [$cucurbit #Plant*]seedling tissue reflects the differences between group I and II strains established by visual assessment of [$BFB#Disease*] symptom severity.
Spray inoculation of [$melon seedlings#Plant*] with cell suspensions containing approxi[$mate#Plant*]ly 1 x 10(4) CFU/ml resulted in significantly higher (P = 0.01) population growth of M6 (group I; mean area under population growth curve [AUPGC] = 43.73) than that of [$AAC#Virus*]00-1 (group II; mean AUPGC = 39.33) by 10 days after inoculation.
We also investigated the natural spread of bacterial cells and the resulting [$BFB#Disease*] incidence on [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon seedlings#Plant*] exposed to three group I and three group II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains under mist chamber conditions.
After 5 days of exposure, the mean [$BFB#Disease*] incidence on [$melon seedlings#Plant*] exposed to representative group II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains was significantly lower (25 and 3.98% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively) than on [$melon seedlings#Plant*] exposed to representative group I strains (94.44 and 76.11% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively), and on [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] exposed to representative group I and II strains (70 to 93.33%).
Finally, we developed a [$polymerase chain reaction assay#Method*] based on the putative type DI secretion effector gene, Aave_2166, to rapidly distinguish group I and II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains.
This assay will be important for future epidemiological studies on [$BFB#Disease*].
