Globalization has allowed for rapid movement of plant [$pathogens#Virus*] that threaten food security.
Successful disease management largely depends on timely and accurate detection of plant [$pathogens#Virus*] causing epidemics.
Thus, biosurveillance of epidemic plant [$pathogens#Virus*] such as [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], the causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], is becoming a priority to prevent disease outbreaks and deploy successful control efforts.
[@Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)#Method*] facilitates rapid development of genomics resources needed to generate mo[$lecul#Virus*]ar diagnostics assays for [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
Having information regarding the presence or absence of the [$pathogen#Virus*], amount of inoculum, [$crop#Plant*] risk, time to initiate fungicide applications, and effective fungicides to apply would significantly contribute to reducing losses to [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*].
In this article, we discuss approaches to identify unique loci for rapid molecular diagnostics using genomic data, to develop molecular diagnostic tools that discriminate economically important [$pathogen#Virus*] alleles (i.e.
mating type and fungicide resistance), and how to use molecular diagnostics with current and future spore trap strategies for biosurveillance purposes of important [$downy mildew pathogen#Virus*]s.
The combined use of these technologies within the already existent disease management framework has the potential to improve disease control.
