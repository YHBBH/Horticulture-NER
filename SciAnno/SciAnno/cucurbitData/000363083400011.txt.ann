The genetic control of resistance to [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]; [$genus Polerovirus#Virus*], [$family Luteoviridae#Virus*]) in the TGR-1551 [$melon#Plant*] accession was studied through agroinoculation of a genetic family obtained from the cross between this accession and the susceptible Spanish cultivar 'Bola de Oro'.
[$Segregation analyses#Method*] were consistent with the hypothesis that one dominant gene and at least two more modifier genes confer resistance; one of these additional genes is likely present in the susceptible parent 'Bola de Oro'.
Local and systemic accumulation of the virus was analyzed in a time course experiment, showing that TGR-1551 resistance was expressed systemically as a significant reduction of virus accumulation compared with susceptible controls, but not locally in agroinoculated cotyledons.
In [@aphid transmission experiments#Method*], [$CABYV#Virus*] inoculation by aphids was significantly reduced in TGR-1551 plants, although the virus was acquired at a similar rate from TGR-1551 as from susceptible plants.
Results of feeding behavior studies using the DC electrical penetration graph technique suggested that viruliferous aphids can salivate and feed from the phloem of TGR-1551 plants and that the observed reduction in virus transmission efficiency is not related to reduced salivation by [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*] in phloem sieve elements.
Since the virus is able to accumulate to normal levels in agroinoculated tissues, our results suggest that resistance of TGR-1551 plants to [$CABYV#Virus*] is related to impairment of virus movement or translocation after it reaches the phloem sieve elements.
