Two methods for the detection of [@Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) on infected plants were developed, based on the information provided by cDNA clones covering the 3'-end of the genome of a Spanish isolate ([$CVYV#Virus*]-AILM).
The sequenced portion of the [$CVYV#Virus*]-AILM genome showed a 96.6% aminoacid identity with that of a reported sequence of another [$CVYV#Virus*] isolate from Israel ( Lecoq et al., 2000).
The first detection method used a [@RNA specific probe for hybridization with nucleic acids#Method*] extracted from infected plants.
The probe was complementary to a portion of the [$CVYV#Virus*] genome including the C-terminal part of the NIb and most of the [$coat protein#Gene*] ( [$CP#Gene*]) coding regions.
The second detection method [@employed polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant viral CP expressed in bacteria#Method*].
The specific antibodies were used to detect the presence of virus particles in plant extracts.
Both procedures resulted in a highly specific detection of [$CVYV#Virus*] in plants infected with different isolates of the virus.
No interference was observed with other [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting viruses.
Sensitivities achieved were sufficient for routine diagnosis of the presence of the virus in plants.
