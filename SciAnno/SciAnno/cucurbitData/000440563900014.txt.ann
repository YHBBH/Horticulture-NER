[@Snake gourd#Plant*] and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] are the common [$cucurbitaceous vegetables#Plant*] consumed in India that are prone to viral infections under field conditions.
During our field survey in Southern India in 2012-14, the symptoms viz., stunted growth, mosaic mottling, puckering and chlorosis in these [$crops#Plant*] were observed.
Incidences of virus-like symptoms ranging between 63 and 88% were observed in three different locations.
Based on the [$mechanical inoculation#Method*]s on their respective host, plants produced symptoms similar to those under field conditions.
Samples tested with [$DAS-ELISA#Method*] using [$CMV#Virus*] polyclonal antiserum were found positive for [$CMV#Virus*].
The occurrence of [$CMV#Virus*] was further confirmed by amplification of [$coat protein gene#Gene*] of [$CMV#Virus*] [$using RT-PCR#Method*] assays.
The [$sequence analysis#Method*] of [$coat protein gene#Gene*] revealed highest nucleotide identity of > 92% with [$CMV#Virus*] subgroup IB isolates.
Coding regions from [$CMV#Virus*] RNA 1, RNA 2 and RNA 3 genomic fragments were cloned and sequenced.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of RNA1, RNA 2 and RNA 3 from [$CMV#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]cting [$snake gourd#Plant*] and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] showed close relatedness with Italian isolate that infect [$Capsicum#Plant*] rather than Asian isolates of [$CMV#Virus*] from India, Malaysia, China and Japan.
The characterization of [$CMV#Virus*] from [$snake gourd#Plant*] and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] pertaining to biological, serological and molecular attributes are presented.
