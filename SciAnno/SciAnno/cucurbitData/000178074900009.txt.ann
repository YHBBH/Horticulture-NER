A new strain of the fungus [@Plectosporium tabacinum#Virus*] was isolated from naturally-infected [@false cleavers#Plant*] plants and evaluated as a bioherbicide for the control of both herbicide-resistant and herbicide-susceptible [$false cleavers#Plant*] in [$canola#Plant*].
[$Plectosporium tabacinum#Virus*] was nonpathogenic to both [@Argentine canola#Plant*] and [@Polish canola#Plant*] and to both herbicide-toterant and conventional cultivars.
[$Plectosporium tabacinum#Virus*] killed [$false cleavers#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] when applied at a concentration of 1 x 10(7) [$conidia#Virus*] ml(-1) and provided with 16 h dew.
The efficacy of [@P tabacinum#Virus*] on herbicide-resistant [$false cleavers#Plant*] was identical to that on herbicide-susceptible [$false cleavers#Plant*].
[@Catchweed bedstraw#Plant*] was also highly susceptible to [@R tabacinum#Virus*].
Further host-range tests on 34 plant species in 26 genera and 12 families demonstrated that [$P tabacinum#Virus*] is sufficiently host specific for [$false cleavers#Plant*] control in western Canada.
This [$fungus#Virus*] may provide a novel approach for managing herbicide-resistant [$false cleavers#Plant*].
