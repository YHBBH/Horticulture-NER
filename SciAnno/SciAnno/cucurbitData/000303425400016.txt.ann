Growers are looking for sustainable alternatives to methyl bromide as a soil fumigant that are effective and economical.
Increased demand for organically produced fruits and vegetables has also contributed to the need for environmentally friendly soil-borne disease control methods.
Grafting may be a valuable tool for vegetable growers to cope with pest management challenges in production of cucurbits and solanaceous crops; however, there are concerns regarding the higher costs associated with the use of grafted plants in the United States.
The main objective of this 2-year study was to determine if grafting with a resistant rootstock could be cost-effective to overcome root-knot nematodes (RKN) (Meloidogyne sp.) and maintain fruit yield in organic heirloom [@tomato#Plant*] ([$Solanum lycopersicum#Plant*]) production in Florida's sandy soils.
The heirloom [$tomato#Plant*] cultivar Brandywine was grafted onto the rootstock 'Multifort'.
Nongrafted and grafted 'Brandywine' plants were grown organically in two fields that exhibited different levels of RKN infestations.
Grafted and nongrafted transplants were estimated to cost $0.78 and $0.17 per plant, respectively.
The cost of rootstock seeds accounted for 36% ($0.28/plant) of the total cost of the grafted transplants and 46% of the cost difference between grafted and nongrafted plants.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted using these estimated transplant production costs and [$crop#Plant*] yield data from the field trials as well as price information for heirloom [$tomato#Plant*].
Results showed that under severe RKN pressure, grafting may be an economically feasible pest control measure to help maintain a profitable production given that the risk of economic [$crop#Plant*] losses due to RKN outweighed the higher cost of grafted transplants.
