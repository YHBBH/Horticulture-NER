 Oxyfluorfen (0.28, 0.42, 0.56, and 0.84 kg ai ha-1) under clear polyethylene film was evaluated for [$weed#Plant*] control, [$crop#Plant*] injury, and effects on yields in transplanted [$muskmelon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and[$ summer squash#Plant*].
 Numerous narrowleaf and [$broadleaf weeds#Plant*] were effectively suppressed by 0.42 ha-1 of oxyfluorfen.
 Crop injury, occuring soon after transplanting, was reported in New York and North Carolina.
 Injury was usually transient, and injured [$crops#Plant*] frequently grew more vigorously than those grown on treated black polyethylene mulch.
[$Muskmelon#Plant*]s were consistently the most tolerant of the three [$crops#Plant*].
At high rates, yields of [$squash #Plant*]and [$cucumber#Plant*] in 1988 were reduced in New York and North Carolina, respectively.
 In greenhouse studies, positioning the cotyledons under the polythene film caused greater injury in all three [$crops#Plant*] than when cotyledons remained above the plastic.
