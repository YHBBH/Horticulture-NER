 A set of 155 Cucumis sativus cultivars and newly-bred lines from Europe and the United States was studied under controlled conditions for resistance to one isolate of cucurbit downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk.
and Curt.
Rostow.) originating from cucumbers.
 The cultivars tested showed no resistance to P.
cubensis.
 There were only a few cultivars (e.g.
Anuschka F1, Nora F1, Minerva F1) that exhibited reduced sporulation.
 This phenomenon is discussed in relation to the expression of field resistance in C.
sativus.
