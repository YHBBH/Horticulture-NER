The availability of the genome sequence of many [$crop#Plant*] species during the past few years has opened a new era in plant biology, allowing for the performance of massive genomic studies in plant species other than the classical models [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] and [$rice#Plant*].
One of these [$crop#Plant*] species is [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), a [$cucurbit #Plant*]of high economic value that has become an interesting model for the study of biological processes such as fruit ripening, sex determination and phloem transport.
The recent availability of the [$melon#Plant*] genome sequence, together with a number of genetic and genomic resources, provides powerful tools that can be used to assist in the main [$melon#Plant*] breeding targets, namely disease resistance and fruit quality.
In this review, we will describe recent data obtained combining the use of a [$melon#Plant*] near isogenic line (NIL) population and genomic resources to gain insight into agronomically important traits as fruit ripening, resistance to [$Cucumber#Plant*] [$Mosaic#Disease*] virus ([$CMV#Virus*]) and the accumulation of sugars in fruits.
