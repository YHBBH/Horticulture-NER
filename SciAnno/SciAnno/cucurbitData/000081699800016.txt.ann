The geographic incidence and molecular variation of three [@whitefly-borne closteroviruses#Virus*] ([@lettuce infectious yellows virus#Virus*] [[@LIYV#Virus*]], [$cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] [[$CYSDV#Virus*]], and [$beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] [[$BPYV#Virus*]]) were studied in [$cucurbits#Plant*] collected from several distinct geographic locations.
Of 498 samples analyzed, none were found to be infected by [$LIYV#Virus*].
Sixty-nine samples collected in the Middle East and Mediterranean Europe were found infected by [$CYSDV#Virus*], and twelve samples from Crete and Italy were infected by [$BPYV#Virus*].
[@Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] of a portion of the heat shock protein 70 homolog coding region, followed by [@single-strand conformation polymorphism#Method*] and [@nucleotide sequence analysis#Method*], was used to estimate the intra- and inter-isolate molecular variability.
These analyses showed that each [$BPYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] isolate was composed of a population of sequence variants with a nucleotide identity greater than 98%.
[$CYSDV#Virus*] isolates could be divided into two divergent groups.
Group I was only composed of isolates from Spain, Jordan, and Turkey, and group II isolates were predominantly found in Saudi Arabia.
Nucleotide identity between isolates of the same group was greater than 99%, whereas identity between both groups was less than 92%.
All [$BPYV#Virus*] isolates showed a nucleotide identity greater than 98%.
