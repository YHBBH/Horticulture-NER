Existing crop monitoring programs determine the incidence and distribution of plant diseases and pathogens and assess the damage caused within a [$crop#Plant*] production region.
These programs have traditionally used observed or predicted disease and [$pathogen#Virus*] data and environmental information to prescribe management practices that minimize [$crop#Plant*] loss (3,69).
Monitoring programs are especially important for [$crops#Plant*] with broad geographic distribution or for diseases that can cause rapid and great economic losses.
Successful monitoring programs have been developed for several plant diseases, including [$downy mildew#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$Fusarium head blight#Disease*] of [$wheat#Plant*], [$potato#Plant*] late blight, and rusts of cereal [$crops#Plant*] (13,36,51,80).
   A recent example of a successful disease-monitoring program for an economically important [$crop#Plant*] is the [$soybean rust#Disease*] (SBR) monitoring effort within North America.
SBR, caused by the [$fungus#Virus*] [@Phakopsora pachyrhizi Sydow#Virus*], was first identified in the continental United States in November 2004 (59; Sidebar 1: [@Soybean rust disease#Disease*] cycle).
SBR causes moderate to severe yield losses globally (6,25,42,54).
The [$fungus#Virus*] produces foliar lesions on [$soybean#Plant*] ([@Glycine max Merrill#Plant*]) and other[$ legume#Plant*] hosts.[@P.pachyrhizi#Virus*] diverts nutrients from the host to its own growth and reproduction.
The lesions also reduce photosynthetic area.
Uredinia rupture the host epidermis and diminish stomatal regulation of transpiration to cause tissue desiccation and premature defoliation (Fig.
1) (6).
Severe [$soybean#Plant*] yield losses can occur if plants defoliate during the mid-reproductive growth stages (25,38).
   Since 2004, [$soybean#Plant*] has been produced on approximately 30 million hectares annually in the United States, with a value between $18 billion and $32 billion (74).
Therefore, the threat of this destructive disease warranted the attention of farmers, agricultural industries, university scientists, and national and state/provincial governmental agencies.
The rapid response to the threat of SBR in North America resulted in an unprecedented amount of information dissemination and the development of a real-time, publicly available monitoring and prediction system known as the [@Soybean#Plant*] [$Rust#Plant*]-Pest Information Platform for Extension and Education (SBR-PIPE).
Several comprehensive reviews of SBR and the SBR-PIPE were published (6,21,23,29,33,79).
The objectives of this article are (i) to highlight the successful response effort to SBR in North America, and (ii) to introduce researchers to the quantity and type of data generated by SBR-PIPE.
Data from this system may now be used to answer questions about the biology, ecology, and epidemiology of an important [$pathogen#Virus*] and disease of [$soybean#Plant*].
