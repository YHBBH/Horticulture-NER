[@Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]), a [@whitefly-transmitted virus#Virus*], is a new member of the [$Crinivirus genus#Virus*], that causes major economic losses in [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
To develop immunodiagnostic methods for [$CCYV#Virus*], we produced an antiserum by immunizing rabbits with bacterially expressed recombinant [$coat protein#Gene*] of [$CCYV#Virus*] and detected [$CCYV#Virus*] from [$CCYV#Virus*]-infected plants with [$western blotting#Method*] and immunoelectron microscopy.
[$CCYV#Virus*] in extracts from infected plants was also readily detected by double antibody sandwich [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] with high sensitivity and specificity.
A [$tissue blot immunoassay#Method*] indicated that [$CCYV#Virus*] localizes in the phloem tissues of the petiole and is distributed in tiny spots within the leaf lamina.
