Symptom expression and levels of the ipomovirus [@Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) and the [@crinivirus Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) were compared in greenhouse [$cucumbers#Plant*] in single and mixed infections.
Results were contrasted with those obtained for plants infected with the [$potyvirus#Virus*] [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) in single and in mixed infections with either [$CVYV#Virus*] or [$CYSDV#Virus*].
[$Cucumber#Plant*] showed leaf symptoms of each co-infecting virus, except for the combination of [$CYSDV#Virus*] with [$ZYMV#Virus*], where the typical [$CYSDV#Virus*]-like symptoms of interveinal leaf yellowing were inconspicuous or absent.
The progression of [$CVYV#Virus*] as quantified by [@real-time RT-PCR#Method*] was similar in plants with single infections and in mixed infection with [$CYSDV#Virus*] between 15 and 60 days post-inoculation (dpi).
However, [$CYSDV#Virus*] was detected at significantly enhanced levels in plants when co-infected with [$CVYV#Virus*] but not when co-infected with [$ZYMV#Virus*].
In the latter case, [$ZYMV#Virus*] levels were reduced when compared with single infections.
During mixed infections of [$ZYMV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*], the titre levels of the ipomovirus were significantly lower when compared with single infections.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] had reduced plant height, internode length, dry weight and fruit yield, positively correlated with the titre levels of [$CVYV#Virus*] and not of [$CYSDV#Virus*] during mixed infections.
It is concluded that co-infections with [$CVYV#Virus*] enhance the titre of [$CYSDV#Virus*], which could have epidemiological significance.
