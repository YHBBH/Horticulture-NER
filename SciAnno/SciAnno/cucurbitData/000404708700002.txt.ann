Field surveys were conducted during 2012-14 to document the occurrence and distribution of viruses infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in all the seven agroclimatic zones of Tamil Nadu state, south India.
Samples collected from various types of [$cucurbits#Plant*] showing virus-like symptoms were tested for [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) and [$begomoviruses#Virus*] [@using serological (Dot Immuno Binding Assay, DIBA)#Method*] and molecular ([$RT-PCR#Method*] for RNA viruses and [$PCR#Method*] for DNA viruses) methods.
Results indicated higher incidence (98.6%) of [$begomoviruses#Virus*], followed by [$PRSV#Virus*] (32.1%) and [$CGMMV#Virus*] (22.2%).
[$ZYMV#Virus*] and [$CMV#Virus*] were detected at a lower frequency of 7.1% and 5%, respectively.
Mixed infections with two or three of these viruses were observed in more than 50% of the samples analyzed.
Sequencing of [$begomovirus#Virus*]-specific amplicons indicated the presence of sequences highly similar to [$Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus#Virus*] ([$ToLCNDV#Virus*]) and [$Squash leaf curl China virus#Virus*] ([@SLCCNV#Virus*]).
