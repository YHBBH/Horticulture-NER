[@Glasshouse experiments#Method*] were conducted to assess differences in clomazone tolerance between US [$pumpkin#Plant*] cultivars that were first observed when the herbicide was used for [$weed#Plant*] control in a [$pumpkin#Plant*] variety evaluation experiment.
Two [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] cultivars, Big Max and Mammoth Gold, were highly tolerant and did not exhibit shoot weight reduction at a potting-medium clomazone concentration of 64 mg kg(-1) (w/w), four times the clomazone concentration that severely injured and reduced the shoot weight of the less tolerant [@C.pepo#Plant*] variety, Magic Lantern.
A subsequent experiment to assess the response of 67 [$pumpkin#Plant*] cultivars demonstrated that while most [@C.maxima#Plant*] cultivars tested were not sensitive to [$clomazone#Method*], the response of [$C.pepo#Plant*] cultivars varied greatly.
