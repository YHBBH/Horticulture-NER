The [@Tobamovirus Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) is considered a major risk for [$cucurbit crop#Plant*] production.
In 2013, an outbreak of [$CGMMV#Virus*] in [$watermelon#Plant*] fields occurred in Israel causing severe [$crop#Plant*] damage.
This event raised concern regarding the virus preservation potential in [$weeds#Plant*] within and surrounding cultivated [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
Out of 11 surveyed [$weed#Plant*] species, six were [$ELISA#Method*]-positive for [$CGMMV#Virus*], although they were asymptomatic: [@Moluccella laevis#Virus*], [@Withania somnifera#Virus*], [@Amaranthus graecizans#Virus*], [@A.muricatus#Virus*], [$Ecballium elaterium#Plant*] and [@Chrozophora tinctoria#Virus*].
The presence of [$CGMMV#Virus*] in the [$weed#Plant*] species was verified by [@RT-PCR analysis#Method*] and by bioassay to healthy [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] plants and to non-infected [$weed#Plant*] species.
These results add species inside the [$Solanaceae#Plant*], Euphorbiaceae and [$Lamiaceae#Plant*] families to [$CGMMV#Virus*] host range in [$weeds#Plant*].
Thus, [$weeds#Plant*] reservoir within and surrounding infected fields needs to be considered as a potential source for [$CGMMV#Virus*] infection of cultivated plants.
