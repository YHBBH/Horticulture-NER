Increase in [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] symptom severity in tolerant [$[$zucchini#Plant*] cultivars is related to a point mutation in P3 protein and is associated with a loss of relative fitness on susceptible plants.
Phytopathology 93:1478-1484.
   [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*], [$Potyvirus#Virus*]) is a very damaging [$cucurbit#Plant*] virus worldwide.
Interspecific crosses with resistant [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] have led to the release of "resistant" [$zucchini squash#Plant*] ([$C.pepo#Plant*]) F, hybrids.
However, although the resistance is almost complete in [$C.moschata#Plant*], the commercial [$C.pepo#Plant*] hybrids are only tolerant.
[$ZYMV#Virus*] evolution toward increased aggressiveness on tolerant hybrids was observed in the field and was obtained experimentally.
Sequence comparisons and recombination experiments revealed that a point mutation in the P3 protein of [$ZYMV#Virus*] was enough to induce tolerance breaking.
Competition experiments were performed between quasi-isogenic wildtype, and aggressive variants of [$ZYMV#Virus*] distinguished by monoclonal antibodies.
The aggressive mutants were more fit than wild-type strains in mixed infections of tolerant [$zucchini#Plant*], but they presented a drastic fitness loss in mixed infections of susceptible [$zucchini#Plant*] or [$melon#Plant*].
Thus, the ability to induce severe symptoms in tolerant [$zucchini#Plant*] is related to a genetic load in susceptible [$zucchini#Plant*], but also on other susceptible hosts.
This represents the first quantitative study of the fitness cost associated with tolerance breaking for a plant virus.
Thus, although easily broken, the tolerance might prove durable in some conditions if the aggressive variants are counterselected in susceptible [$crops#Plant*].
