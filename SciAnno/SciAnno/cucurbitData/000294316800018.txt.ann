   A novel monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific to the seedborne bacterium [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] was produced.
MAb 11E5 reacted specifically with 19 strains of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]but not with three closely related bacteria in the [@family Comamonadaceae#Virus*] (i.e., [@A.facilis#Virus*].Comamonas acidovorans, and [@C.testosteroni#Virus*]) and another seven phyto[$pathogen#Virus*]ic bacteria.
Moreover, this MAb detected a strain of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]that was not detected by a commercial [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*])-[@based kit and a commercial immunochromatographic strip test#Method*].
In [$Western blot analysis#Method*], MAb 11E5 reacted with an [$A.citrulli #Virus*]protein of a molecular mass >170 kDa.
MAb 11E5 was employed to develop two sandwich [$ELISA#Method*] systems: [@MAb captured-sandwich ELISA#Method*] ([@MC-sELISA#Method*]) and [@polyclonal antibody captured-sandwich ELISA#Method*] ([@PC-sELISA#Method*]).
[$MC-sELISA#Method*] was 10 times more sensitive than [$PC-sELISA#Method*] for detection of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in [$cucurbit #Plant*]leaf and [$seed extracts#Plant*].
The detection limit of the [$MC-sELISA#Method*] was 5 x 10(4) CFU/ml.
Detection of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in naturally infected [$cucurbit #Plant*]leaves, fruit, and seed was also feasible using [$MC-sELISA#Method*].
The newly established [$MC-sELISA#Method*] provides another alternative for specific detection of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in [$cucurbits#Plant*] and can be applied for routine field inspection.
