Management of [$cucumber#Plant*] fly (Bactrocera [$cucumis#Plant*]) has relied heavily on cover sprays of broad spectrum insecticides such as dimethoate and fenthion.
Long term access to these insecticides is uncertain, and their use can disrupt integrated pest management programs for other pests such as [$whitefly#Virus*], aphids and mites.
Application of a protein bait spray for [$fruit fly#Plant*] control is common practice in tree [$crops#Plant*].
However, [$vegetable crops#Plant*] present different challenges as fruit flies are thought to enter these [$crops#Plant*] only to oviposit, spending the majority of their time in roosting sites outside of the [$crop#Plant*]ping area.
Perimeter baiting of non-[$crop#Plant*] vegetation was developed overseas as a technique for control of [$melon fly#Virus*] ([$B.cucurbitae#Virus*]) in [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Hawaii.
More recent work has refined the technique further, with certain types of perimeter vegetation proving more attractive to [$melon fly#Virus*] than the [$sorghum#Plant*] or [$corn#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] which are commonly utilised.
Trials were performed to investigate the potential of developing a similar system for [$cucumber#Plant*] fly.
Commercially available [$fruit fly#Plant*] baits were compared for attractiveness to [$cucumber#Plant*] fly.
Eight plant species were evaluated for their relative attractiveness to [$cucumber#Plant*] flies as roosting sites.
Differences were observed in the number of flies feeding at protein bait applied to each of the plants.
Results are discussed in the context of the development of a perimeter baiting system for [$cucumber#Plant*] fly in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
