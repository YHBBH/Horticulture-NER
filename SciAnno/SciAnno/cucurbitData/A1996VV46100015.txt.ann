[@Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) is a tentative member of the [@luteovirus#Virus*] group transmitted by [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] and [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*].
Five hundred twenty-three [$Cucumis melo L#Plant*].
accessions were screened in field conditions in the south of France under severe natural inoculum pressure.
[@Double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays#Method*] were conducted to confirm the presence or absence of virus in the plants.
Several potential sources of [$CABYV#Virus*] resistance were found, most originating from India, but some from Korea and Africa.
The resistance of the most promising genotypes was confirmed in a field trial in five locations and under controlled conditions, with viruliferous [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] used to inoculate plants.
Genotypes found to be resistant were Faizabadi Phoont, 90625, PI 124112, PI 124440, PI 255478, PI 282448, and PI 414723.
