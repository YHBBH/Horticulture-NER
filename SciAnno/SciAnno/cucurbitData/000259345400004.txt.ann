A homothallic [@Phytophthora sp.#Virus*]
was recovered from [$asparagus#Plant*] ([@Asparagus officinalis#Plant*]) spears, storage roots, crowns, and stems in northwest and central Michigan in 2004 and 2005.
Isolates (n = 131) produced ovoid, nonpapillate, noncaducous sporangia 45 mu m long x 26 mu m wide and amphigynous oospores of 25 to 30 mu m diameter.
Mycelial growth was optimum at 25 degrees C with no growth at 5 and 30 degrees C.
All isolates were sensitive to 100 ppm mefenoxam.
Pathogenicity studies confirmed the ability of the isolates to infect [$asparagus#Plant*] as well as [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of 99 isolates revealed identical fingerprints, with 12 clearly resolved fragments present and no clearly resolved polymorphic fragments, suggesting a single clonal lineage.
The internal transcribed spacer regions of representative isolates were homologous with a P[@hytophthora sp.#Virus*]
isolated from diseased [$asparagus#Plant*] in France and a [@Phytophthora sp.#Virus*]
from agave in Australia.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] supports the conclusion that the [$Phytophthora#Virus*] sp.
isolated from [$asparagus#Plant*] in Michigan is a distinct species, and has been named [$Phytophthora asparagi#Virus*].
