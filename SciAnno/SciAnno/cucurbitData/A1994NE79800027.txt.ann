 Cotyledon explants of four [$watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.& Nakai#Plant*]] breeding lines (F92U8, SP90-1, SP90-2, and SP90-4) were prepared from mature seed or from 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, or 10-day-old [$seedlings#Plant*].
Explants were incubated on shoot regeneration medium for 8 weeks followed by 4 weeks on shoot elongation medium.
The four genotypes differed in their ability to produce shoots at each explant age.
The highest frequency with which F92U8 (66 %) and SP90-2 (60 %) explants produced shoots was for 2-day-old [$seedlings#Plant*].
Fewer explants formed shoots when established from mature seed or [$seedlings#Plant*] older than 2 days.
In contrast, the percentage of SP90-4 explants that produced shoots was highest when cotyledons were obtained from 4-day-old [$seedlings#Plant*] (40 %), but the response was less than the optimum for F92U8 and SP90-2.
SP90-1 cotyledon explants exhibited the poorest response of the four breeding lines (<11 % produced shoots), with little difference in response among the explant ages tested.
The number of shoots per responding explant also depended on the age of the explant source.
Explants from 2- to 4-day-old [$seedlings#Plant*] produced the most shoots.
Fewer shoots formed on cotyledons from mature seed or [$seedlings#Plant*] older than 4 days.
