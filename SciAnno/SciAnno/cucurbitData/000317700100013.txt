Seed dormancy in wild cucurbit species very often interferes with the results of routine germination tests conducted by genebanks.
Seed coat impermeability to water causes physical dormancy in Momordica cochinchinensis.
To ensure conservation of rare and important germplasm, it is important to determine the most suitable means of overcoming physical dormancy which can promote rapid and uniform germination, freshly harvested, dried seeds of M.
cochinchinensis were subjected to different dormancy breaking treatments.
Removal of the entire seed coat increased germination from 0% (control) to 89%.
This increase may be due to the removal of the restriction of water entry by the seed coat into the seed.
Chemical scarification with concentrated sulphuric acid and hot water treatment were less effective in promoting germination.
