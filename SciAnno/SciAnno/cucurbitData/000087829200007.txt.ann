Differential activities of BOA, DIBOA, and crude water extract of Secale cereale 'Elbon' were studied in culture dish bioassays using several vegetable and weed species.
On average, DIBOA was about seven times more inhibitory to root growth and four times more inhibitory to shoot growth than BOA.
Allelochemicals from S.cereale inhibited shoot more than root elongation of [$cucurbits#Plant*] [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], and [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
Small-seeded [$crops#Plant*] [@Lycopersicon esculentum#Plant*] and [@Lactuca sativa#Plant*] were sensitive to [$S.cereale#Plant*].
Large-seeded [$crops#Plant*], including the [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [@Zea mays var.rogusa#Plant*], were tolerant.
Among the small-seeded [$weeds#Plant*] [@Amaranthus palmeri#Plant*], [@Digitaria sanguinalis#Plant*], [@Echinochloa crus-galli#Plant*], and [@Eleusine indica#Plant*], [@E.crus-galli#Plant*] was least susceptible.
Inhibition of germination by BOA or DIBOA occurred only in small- to medium-seeded species, including [@A.palmeri#Plant*], [@D.sanguinalis#Plant*], [@E.indica#Plant*], [@L.sativa#Plant*], [@L.esculentum#Plant*], and [@Sida spinosa#Plant*].
Large-seeded species [$C.melo#Plant*], [$C.sativus#Plant*], [@C.melopepo#Plant*], [@Z.mays var.rogusa#Plant*], [@Ipomoea hederacea var.integriuscula#Plant*], [@Ipomoea lacunosa#Plant*], and [@Senna obtusifolia#Plant*] were tolerant to allelochemicals from S.cereale.
This bioassay indicated a promising potential for controlling small-seeded [$weeds#Plant*] in large-seeded [$crops#Plant*].
