Key messageSix QTLs were associated with affected leaf area in response to inoculation with [@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] in a recombinant inbred line population of[@ Citrullus amarus.AbstractAcidovorax citrulli#Virus*], the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]) of [$cucurbits#Plant*], has the potential to devastate production of [$watermelon#Plant*] and other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Despite decades of research on host-plant resistance to [$A.citrulli#Virus*], no germplasm has been found with immunity and only a few sources with various levels of [$BFB#Disease*] resistance have been identified, but the genetic basis of resistance in these [$watermelon#Plant*] sources are not known.
Most sources of resistance are plant introductions of [$Citrullus amarus#Virus*] ([$citron#Plant*] [$melon#Plant*]), a closely related species that crosses readily with cultivated [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus L.#Plant*]).
In this study, we evaluated a recombinant inbred line population (N=200), derived from a cross between [$BFB#Disease*]-resistant (USVL246-FR2) and [$BFB#Disease*]-susceptible (USVL114) [$C.amarus#Plant*] lines, for foliar resistance to [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in three replicated greenhouse trials.
We found the genetics of [$BFB#Disease*] resistance to be complicated by strong environmental influence, low heritability and significant genotype-by-environment interactions.
QTL mapping of affected leaf area identified six QTL that each explained between 5 and 15% of the variation in [$BFB#Disease*] resistance in the population.
This study represents the first identification of QTL associated with resistance to [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in any [$cucurbit#Virus*].
