A continuous-dip inoculation technique for rapid assessment of pathogenicity of [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] and [@F.o.melonis#Virus*] was developed.
The method, adapted from a similar procedure for determining pathogenicity of [$Colletotrichum magna#Virus*] (causal agent of [$anthracnose#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*]), involves constant exposure of [$seedlings#Plant*] and cuttings ([$seedlings#Plant*] with root systems excised) of [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$muskmelon#Plant*] to [$conidia#Virus*]l suspensions contained in small scintillation vials.
Disease development in intact [$seedlings#Plant*] corresponded well to disease responses observed with the standard root-dip inoculation/pot assay.
The continuous-dip inoculation technique resulted in rapid disease development, with 50% of [$watermelon#Plant*] cuttings dying after 4-6 days of exposure to F.o.niveum.
A mortality of 30% also was observed in [$watermelon#Plant*] cuttings exposed to [$conidia#Virus*] of [$F.o.melonis#Virus*], as opposed to only a 0-2.5% mortality in [$seedlings#Plant*] with intact roots.
Disease response was similar with [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] and cuttings continuously dip-inoculated with [$F.o.melonis#Virus*] isolates.
However, no disease symptoms were observed in [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] or cuttings inoculated with F.o.niveum.
Four nonpathogenic isolates of [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]did not cause disease symptoms in either [$watermelon#Plant*] or [$muskmelon#Plant*] cuttings and [$seedlings#Plant*] when assayed by this technique.
The proposed method enables a rapid screening of pathogenicity and requires less time, labor, and greenhouse space than the standard root-dip inoculation/pot assay.
The reliability of the continuous-dip inoculation technique is limited, however, to exposure of intact [$seedlings#Plant*] at a concentration of 1 X 10(6) [$conidia#Virus*] per milliliter; the method is not accurate at this range for excised [$seedlings#Plant*].
