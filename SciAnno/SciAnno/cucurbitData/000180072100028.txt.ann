The response of [@Cucumis melo#Plant*] genotypes MR-1 and PI 124112 to 72 isolates of [$powdery mildew#Disease*] ([$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*], [$Erysiphe cichoracearum#Virus*]) originating from [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]was evaluated on leaf discs in vitro as a part of pathotype and race determination programme in the Czech Republic.
Of eight isolates of [$S.fuliginea#Virus*] only one produced symptoms of a reduced [$mycelium#Virus*] development on leaf discs of MR-1.
Of 33 isolates of [$E.cichoracearum#Virus*] one isolate was virulent to the MR-1, while six other isolates expressed infection capability to MR-1 which reacted with symptoms of incomplete resistance.
From a total of 31 mixed ([$E.cichoracearum#Virus*] + [$S.fuliginea#Virus*]) isolates only one was virulent on the MR-1 and one on the PI 124112.
These genotypes expressed incomplete resistance after inoculation with eight mixed isolates.
