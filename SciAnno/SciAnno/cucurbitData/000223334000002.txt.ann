The [@cucurbit family#Plant*] includes a number of valuable [$crop#Plant*] species ([$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*]/[$pumpkin#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*]).
Much of this review is concerned with transgenic resistance to viruses, shown to be the major application of biotechnology in the [$cucurbit family#Plant*].
Progress made with the production of transgenic [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] is discussed.
Published data on field tests of transgenic [$cucurbits#Plant*] are reviewed, showing that much progress has been made with multiple virus-resistant [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] which can be productive without chemical control of insect virus vectors.
Modes of virus resistance in transgenic [$cucurbits#Plant*] are discussed, as is the bio-safety of such [$crops#Plant*].
For the first time a detailed analysis has been made of world-wide and US field test applications for [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
World-wide, most field test applications were for [$melon#Plant*] (54%), followed by [$squash #Plant*](32%).
World-wide most field test applications were for virus resistance (84%), and most applications (77%) were in the USA.
Two transgenic multiple virus-resistant [$squash #Plant*][$crops#Plant*] have been deregulated (released for sale).
Additionally, the analysis shows that there are transgenic multiple virus-resistant [$crops#Plant*] in all major [$cucurbit#Plant*] species already available, for which several different companies have applied for field tests.
This would imply that such [$crops#Plant*] are ready to be marketed should conditions permit, which would have an impact world-wide in reduction of ecological damage due to chemical control of the insect viral vectors.
