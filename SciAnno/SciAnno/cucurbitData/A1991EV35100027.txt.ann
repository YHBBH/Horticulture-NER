A mild variant of [@zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV-WK#Plant*]) that had been selected from a severe strain of [$ZYMV#Virus*] in France was used for [$cross-protection#Plant*] tests in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Taiwan.
 Under g[$reenhouse#Virus*] conditions, [$ZYMV-WK#Plant*] provided protection in [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$zucchini squash#Plant*] against four severe strains originally from Connecticut, Florida, France, and Taiwan.
 Cross protection was more effective against the French strain, from which the mild strain was derived.
 Two field trials with [$zucchini#Plant*] squach under moderate and high disease pressures showed that [$ZYMV-WK#Plant*] provided excellent [$cross protectio#Method*]n against the Taiwan strain of [$ZYMV#Virus*].
 Yields of marketable fruit were 2.2 and 40 times greater than those of control plants under moderate and high disease pressure conditions, respectively.
