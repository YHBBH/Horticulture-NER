RNA silencing is a conserved antiviral defence mechanism that has been used to develop robust resistance against plant virus infections.
Previous efforts have been made to develop RNA silencing-mediated resistance to criniviruses, yet none have given immunity.
In this study, transgenic [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] plants harbouring a hairpin construct of the [$Lettuce infectious yellows virus#Virus*] ([$LIYV#Virus*]) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence exhibited immunity to systemic [$LIYV#Virus*] nfection.
Deep sequencing analysis was performed to characterize virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) generated on systemic [$LIYV#Virus*] infection in non-transgenic N.
benthamiana plants as well as transgene-derived siRNAs (t-siRNAs) derived from the immune-[$transgenic plants#Plant*] before and after [$LIYV#Virus*] inoculation.
Interestingly, a similar sequence distribution pattern was obtained with t-siRNAs and vsiRNAs mapped to the transgene region in both immune and susceptible plants, except for a significant increase in t-siRNAs of 24 nucleotides in length, which was consistent with small RNA northern blot results that showed the abundance of t-siRNAs of 21, 22 and 24 nucleotides in length.
The accumulated 24-nucleotide sequences have not yet been reported in [$transgenic plants#Plant*] partially resistant to criniviruses, and thus may indicate their correlation with crinivirus immunity.
To further test this hypothesis, we developed transgenic [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) plants immune to systemic infection of another crinivirus, [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]).
As predicted, the accumulation of 24-nucleotide t-siRNAs was detected in transgenic [$melon plants#Plant*] by northern blot.
Together with our findings and previous studies on crinivirus resistance, we propose that the accumulation of 24-nucleotide t-siRNAs is associated with crinivirus immunity in [$transgenic plants#Plant*].
