[@Podosphaera fusca#Virus*] is the main causal agent of [@cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] in Spain.
Four [$Bacillus subtilis#Virus*] strains, UMAF6614, UMAF6619, UMAF6639, and UMAF8561, with proven ability to suppress the disease on [$melon#Plant*] in detached leaf and [@seedling assays#Method*], were subjected to further analyses to elucidate the mode of action involved in their biocontrol performance.
[@Cell-free supernatants#Method*] showed antifungal activities very close to those previously reported for vegetative cells.
Identification of three lipopeptide antibiotics, surfactin, fengycin, and iturin A or bacillomycin, in butanolic extracts from cell-free culture filtrates of these [@B.subtilis#Virus*] strains pointed out that antibiosis could be a major factor involved in their biocontrol ability.
The strong inhibitory effect of purified lipopeptide fractions corresponding to bacillomycin, fengycin, and iturin A on [@P fusca conidia#Virus*] germination, as well as the in situ detection of these lipopeptides in bacterial-treated [$melon#Plant*] leaves, provided interesting evidence of their putative involvement in the antagonistic activity.
Those results were definitively supported by site-directed mutagenesis analysis, targeted to suppress the biosynthesis of the different lipopeptides.
Taken together, our data have allowed us to conclude that the iturin and fengycin families of lipopeptides have a major role in the antagonism of [$B.subtilis#Virus*] toward [@P fusca#Virus*].
