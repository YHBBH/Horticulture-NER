[@Seed-borne pathogens#Virus*] pose a serious threat to modern agricultural [$crop#Plant*]ping systems, as they can be disseminated to many geographical regions around the world.
With trends of increasing global seed production and trade, seed-health testing is an important quality control step to prevent the introduction of harmful [$pathogens#Virus*] into agricultural production systems.
An effective seed-health assay depends on a test that can provide timely, sensitive and broad-spectrum detection of all genetic variants of a [$pathogen#Virus*], or in some cases, of several different [$pathogens#Virus*].
Previously, we developed a [@real-time PCR (qPCR) assay#Method*] that would permit the simultaneous detection of two major [@seed-borne pathogens #Virus*]of [$cucurbits#Plant*], the bacterium [@Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] ([$AAC#Virus*], the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*]) and a [$fungus Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] ([@DB#Virus*], the causal agent of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*]).
The objective of the present study was to develop a [@sensitive, reverse transcriptase (RT)-based#Method*], [$qRT-PCR#Method*] for broad spectrum detection of both serotypes of [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), that could be incorporated into a simultaneous detection of three [$pathogen#Virus*] types in a single [$PCR#Method*] reaction.
Converting [$SqMV#Virus*] RNA to cDNA prior to multiplexing stabilized the viral template that was then mixed with two other DNA templates ([$AAC#Virus*] and [$DB#Virus*]).
To facilitate seed health testing, a generic plant nucleic acid extraction method was developed for [$cucurbit seeds#Plant*].
Using this method, nucleic acids extracted from seeds yielded strong signals for each target [$pathogen#Virus*] in [@multiplex qPCR#Method*].
The ability to use a general nucleic acid extraction technique with subsequent [$PCR#Method*] to detect bacterial, fungal and viral plant [$pathogens#Virus*] lends itself to a universal system for [$cucurbit #Plant*]seed health testing.
