The geographic incidence, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of [@Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ( [$MNSV#Virus*]) and Olpidium isolates were studied in three [$cucurbit species #Plant*]from several Latin American and European countries on different collecting dates.
Of the 112 [$cucurbit #Plant*]samples analysed, 69 from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and Spain were [$DAS-ELISA#Method*]-positive for [$MNSV#Virus*].
Olpidium bornovanus and O.virulentus infections, and [$MNSV#Virus*] infections mixed with these Olpidium species, were observed for all these countries.
Twenty-nine [$MNSV#Virus*] isolates from all the origins where the virus was detected were selected and amplified by [$RT-PCR#Method*].
The resulting [$RT-PCR#Method*] of the p29, p89, p7A, p7B and p42 proteins was used to estimate the genetic diversity and the phylogenetic relationships of the [$MNSV#Virus*] population.
The sequences obtained in this study were compared with the [$MNSV#Virus*] sequences of the NCBI database, and three groups were recovered by nucleotide composition according to geographical origins: the EU-LA genotype group ( with two subgroups: EU and LA, European and Latin American isolates, respectively), the JP [$melon#Plant*] genotype group ( Japanese [$melon#Plant*] reference isolates) and the JP [$watermelon#Plant*] genotype group ( Japanese [$watermelon#Plant*] reference isolates).
The genetic diversity in the entire p7A and p7B proteins of [$MNSV#Virus*] suggests that these coding regions are under strong selective pressure.
Additionally, the rDNA-ITS region was analysed in 40 [$O.bornovanus#Virus*] and [@O.virulentus#Virus*] isolates associated with each geographical location and host examined.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] showed two groups for each Olpidium species, and these groupings were related to the host from which they were originally isolated.
