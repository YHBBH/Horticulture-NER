[@Cucurbit crops#Plant*] are cultivated throughout the world.
[$Melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]), [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Mat.et Nak.#Plant*]), [$squash #Plant*]and [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]) are the major [$crops#Plant*].
In Latin America and the Caribbean islands (LAC) [$cucurbits#Plant*] are consumed as a part of the daily diet since pre-Columbian times, when some species such as [@Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*], [@Cucurbita moschata Duch.#Plant*]
and [@Cucurbita maxima Duch.#Plant*]
were domesticated by American Indians.
In LAC, [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] have become export commodities and a source of income for several countries, in addition to their role in local consumption.
The increase of area devoted to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] and the intensification of production has led to the emergence of severe viral epidemics that threaten the sustainability of these cultures.
This paper reviews the [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]described in the region and their impact.
In addition, the potential of different measures to control the most frequent [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]in LAC is discussed.
