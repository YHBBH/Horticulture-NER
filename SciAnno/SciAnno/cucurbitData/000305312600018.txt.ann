[@Bitter gourd#Plant*] ([$Momordica charantia Linn.#Plant*]) is an important [$vegetable#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*].
We developed 11 polymorphic [$M.charantia microsatellite#Plant*] loci and examined the genetic diversity of 55 Chinese [$M.charantia#Plant*] germplasm cultivars at these loci.
The average number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 8, the expected heterozygosity of each locus varied from 0.132 to 0.786 with an average of 0.621, and the maximum polymorphism information content value was 0.744 with an average of 0.572.
These values suggested that the tested [$M.charantia#Plant*] germplasm has a relatively high genetic diversity at the 11 microsatellite loci.
Based on transferability testing, some of these [$M.charantia microsatellite#Plant*] markers were transferable to eight other [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
Thus the development of these markers has enriched the microsatellite marker bank of [$cucurbit species#Plant*]; they can be used as a powerful tool for studying the genetic diversity of the germplasm of [$M.charantia#Plant*] and other [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
