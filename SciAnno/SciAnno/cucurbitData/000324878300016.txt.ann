The effects of plant growth regulators (PRGs) on the induction of flowering and sex expression in micropropagated [@cucumbers#Plant*] are presented.
The highest number of male flowers (6.0 +/- 0.7 per plant) was produced by cv.
Kmicic F1 on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 4.0 mu M kinetin.
The highest number of female flowers (3.1 +/- 0.3) was also observed in cv.
Kmicic F1 on either control (PRG-free) medium or medium supplemented with 6.4 mu M indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).
The MS medium supplemented with 4.4 mu M benzyladenine inhibited flower formation.
The highest percentage of flowering plantlets (67.5 +/- 7.5) was observed on the control MS medium after 16 weeks of culture.
Female-to-male flower ratio was influenced by the culture media and changed during cultivation.
The highest pollen viability (60-70 %) was observed in anthers of plants cultured on the control medium and the medium with IAA.
