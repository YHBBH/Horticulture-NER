[@Bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits#Disease*] is a destructive disease caused by [$Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], which is a typical seedborne [$pathogen#Virus*].
in seed health testing for this disease, we have detected many strains of Acidovorax with some differences from [@A.avenue subsp.citrulli#Virus*].
Their 16S rRNA sequences were divided into six types.
The most common sequence was completely consistent with that of [@A.avenue subsp.avenue#Virus*] originally isolated from [$rice#Plant*].
The other sequences were over 99% similar but not identical to those of A.avenue subsp.
avenue and [$A.avenue subsp.citrulli#Virus*].
Some commercialized antibodies against [$A.avenue subsp.citrulli#Virus*] reacted with several of these strains.
Some of these strains incited yellow spots or brownish water-soaked lesions mainly on young true leaves of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]after spray inoculation.
Histological observations showed that these strains entered the leaf tissues of [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] through stomata and multiplied in the intercellular spaces of parenchymatous tissues as well as in the vascular tissues.
The amount of bacterial multiplication and spread in the tissues differed among the strains, presumably reflecting their ability to induce symptoms.
These isolated strains are therefore different from [$A.avenue subsp.citrulli#Virus*], and their potential threat to the cultivation of [$cucurbits#Plant*] is lower than that of [$A.avenue subsp.citrulli#Virus*].
