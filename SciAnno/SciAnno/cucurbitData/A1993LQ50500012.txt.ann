Strategies based on the application of biotechnologies to [$crop#Plant*] improvement programmes generally require regeneration of whole plants from cells or tissues cultivated in vitro.
In [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], regeneration can occur either through a caulogenic or an embryogenic developmental pathway.
Reports of somatic embryogenesis have dealt with the main cultivated [$crops#Plant*], i.e.
[$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*].
Somatic embryogenesis and plant recovery are obtained from numerous sources including protoplasts, but the best results are observed with explants coming from [$seedlings#Plant*], especially cotyledons and hypocotyls.
The genetic constitution of mother plants also seems to play a key role in the success of embryogenesis, but few systematic studies on genotype effect have been published.
Somatic embryos can exhibit developmental abnormalities, particularly when they arise from protoplast-derived cultures.
Generally, data concerning embryo yield, rate of germination and plant development and characteristics of regenerated plants and their progeny, has not been provided in previous reports.
The potential use of somatic embryogenesis in [$cucurbit #Plant*]breeding programmes is stressed in this review.
