The causal agent of an unusual disease affecting watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in Taiwan was identified as tomato spotted wilt-like virus in the tospovirus group on the basis of particle morphology, host reactions, serology, and transmission by thrips.
 Host symptoms included leaf crinkling, mottling, yellow spotting, short internodes, upright growth of younger branches, and tip necrosis.
 The systemic infection of cucurbits and transmissibility by the vector Thrips palmi distinguished this isolate from most other tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) isolates.
 Serological tests by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the watermelon virus is serologically related to the TSWV that causes silver mottle on watermelon in Okinawa (Japan) and not to the tomato, lettuce, and amaryllis isolates of TSWV from other countries.
