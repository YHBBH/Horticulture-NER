Seven physiological races of the [$cucurbit #Plant*][$anthracnose#Virus*] [$pathogen#Virus*] Collelotrichum orbiculare have been previously described on the basis of disease reactions on 12 differential [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts.
In this study, 89 isolates of [$C orbiculare#Virus*] (35 from [$cucumber#Plant*], 33 from [$watermelon#Plant*], two from [$cantaloupe#Plant*], four from cucuzzi [$gourd#Virus*], two from [$honeydew#Plant*], 10 from cocklebur, and three from unknown [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts) and three isolates of [@C magna#Plant*] (two from [$watermelon#Plant*] and one from [$acorn squash#Plant*]) were examined for vegetative compatibility with the use of nitrate nonutilizing mutants.
The collection included a representative culture of each of the seven previously described races obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Twenty-eight isolates, selected to represent all vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) and several previously identified races, were examined in greenhouse cotyledon inoculation assays on 13 [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts.
Ten VCGs were identified among all isolates examined; however, only isolates in three VCGs (VCGs 1, 2, and 3) were pathogenic on the [$cucurbit #Plant*]differentials in greenhouse virulence tests.
VCG 1 was composed of 28 [$cucumber#Plant*] and two [$cantaloupe#Plant*] isolates, and VCG 2 was composed of 33 [$watermelon#Plant*], two cucuzzi [$gourd#Virus*] isolates, and a single isolate with an unknown host origin.
Seven older [$cucumber#Plant*] isolates, collected prior to 1986, belonged to a third VCG (VCG 3).
Of the three VCGs pathogenic on the [$cucurbit #Plant*]differentials, two virulence phenotypes could be identified.
Isolates in VCG 1 gave disease reactions similar to isolates previously described as race 1, whereas isolates in VCG 2 gave disease reactions similar to isolates previously described as race 2.
The [$cucumber#Plant*] isolates in VCG 3 also gave disease reactions typical of race 1-type disease reactions.
The [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] population pathogenic on [$cucurbits#Plant*] in the United States appears to have a limited VCG diversity.
Within this population, there was a distinct correspondence between host origin, VCG, and virulence (race) phenotype.
