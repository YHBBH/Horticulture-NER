[@Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$ZLCV#Virus*]) is a species of the [$genus Tospovirus#Virus*], in the [@family Bunyaviridae#Virus*], and is transmitted by thrips ([$Frankliniella zucchini#Virus*]).
To date, [$ZLCV#Virus*] has only been reported in Brazil, where it causes a disease known as lethal chlorosis of [$zucchini squash#Plant*].
The aim of this study was to identify additional species susceptible to [$ZLCV#Virus*] through natural infection in the field and to provide subsidies for the establishment of management strategies for the disease.
Six hundred fifty-three samples belonging to 44 plant species representing 13 families were analyzed using [$PTA-ELISA#Method*].
[$ZLCV#Virus*] naturally infected the following species: [@Cucumis anguria#Plant*] (1/12), [@Datura stramonium#Plant*] (1/59) and [$Luffa aegyptiaca#Plant*] (1/3).
This work provides evidence that the main natural hosts of this [$tospovirus#Virus*] are concentrated in the [$cucurbit family#Plant*].
Presently, the management of inoculum sources can minimize the damage caused by this [$tospovirus#Virus*].
