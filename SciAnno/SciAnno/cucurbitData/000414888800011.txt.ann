[@Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) ([$genus Crinivirus#Virus*], [$family Closteroviridae#Virus*]) is implicated in [$cucurbit #Plant*]yellows disease (C[$YV#Disease*]), causing typical interveinal yellowing symptoms in leaves, and is transmitted by [@Bemisia tabaci Mediterranean (MED)#Virus*] and [@Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1)#Virus*].
Due to its recent report in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Greece, field [$surveys#Method*] were conducted during 2011-2016 to determine the presence of the virus in symptomatic [$cucurbits#Plant*] and alternative hosts among arable [$weed#Plant*] species.
Results indicated the restricted spread of the virus and identified 13 [$weed#Plant*] species as [$CCYV#Virus*] hosts for the first time.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA1) coat and minor [$coat proteins#Gene*] (RNA2) revealed very low genetic diversity (< 0.1%) among the Greek isolates.
Transmission experiments were also conducted using B.
tabaci MED with retention determined at four days, whereas transmission efficiency was positively correlated with the number of adults used, features linked to the virus semipersistent mode of transmission.
