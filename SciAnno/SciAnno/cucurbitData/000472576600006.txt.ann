[@Fruit rot#Disease*] is one of the most important diseases of [$cantaloupe#Plant*].
In June 2016, fruit rot was found in [@cantaloupe fruit#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo var.cantalupo#Plant*]) in Phayao Province, Thailand.
The causal fungus was isolated from lesions and identified as [@Fusarium equiseti#Virus*] based on both morphological characteristics and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of combined sequences of the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA, translation elongation factor 1-alpha and -tubulin genes.
[@Cantaloupe fruit#Plant*] inoculated with the isolated [$fungus#Virus*] developed symptoms similar to natural ones in the field.
This is the first report of [$cantaloupe fruit#Plant*] rot caused by [$F.equiseti#Virus*] in Thailand.
