[@Using a high-resolution mapping approach#Method*], we identified a candidate gene for [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*].
Our findings should assist the development of high-versatility [$molecular markers#Method*] for MAS for [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance.
   [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) causes significant disease, which leads to fruit yield loss in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
Since [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance is often inherited recessively in [$cucumber#Plant*], [@marker-assisted selection (MAS)#Method*] is a useful tool for the development of resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] cultivars.
[@Using 128 families of an F-2:3 population derived from a cross between susceptible 'CS-PMR1' and resistant 'A192-18' cucumber inbred lines#Method*], we confirmed that [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance is conferred by a single recessive locus: zym (A192-18) .
We constructed a [$cucumber#Plant*] genetic linkage map that included 125 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers segregating into 7 linkage groups (chromosomes).
The zym (A192-18) locus was mapped to chromosome 6, at genetic distances of 0.9 and 1.3 cM from two closely linked [$SSR markers#Method*].
For [@high-resolution genetic mapping#Method*], we identified new [$molecular markers#Method*] cosegregating with the zym (A192-18) locus; using [$cucumber#Plant*] genomic and molecular marker resources and screening an F-2 population of 2,429 plants, we narrowed down the zym (A192-18) locus to a < 50-kb genomic region flanked by two [$SSR markers#Method*], which included six candidate genes.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] of the candidate genes' coding regions revealed that the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4-like (VPS4-like) gene had two SNPs between the parental lines.
Based on SNPs of the [@VPS-4-like gene#Gene*], we developed zym (A192-18) -linked [$DNA marker#Method*]s and found that genotypes associated with these markers were correlated with the [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance phenotype in 48 [$cucumber#Plant*] inbred lines.
According to our data, the gene encoding VPS4-like protein is a candidate for the zym (A192-18) locus.
These results may be valuable for MAS for [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*].
