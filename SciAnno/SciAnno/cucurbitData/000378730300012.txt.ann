[@Snapmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L#Plant*].
[$Momordica#Plant*] Group; 2n=2x=24) is native to India, where it is widely cultivated and is commonly called 'phut', which means to split.
Immature fruits are cooked or eaten raw.
In this paper we review the wealth of genetic resources in Indian [$snap#Plant*][$melon#Plant*] landraces for resistance to fungal and viral diseases, [$nematodes#Virus*], and insects, and tolerance to drought, soil salinity, and high temperature.
Global [$melon#Plant*] breeding programs have transferred many of these qualities into open-pollinated and hybrid cultivars of [$sweet melon#Plant*]s cultivated in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Americas.
[$Snapmelon#Plant*] is a source of high fruit acidity, a trait that has been utilized to breed uniquely flavored [$melon cultivars#Plant*].
Resistance genes to combat [$pathogens#Virus*] and pests, and to strengthen [$crop#Plant*] resilience against cli[$mate#Plant*] change have been identified in [$snap#Plant*][$melon#Plant*] collections from various parts of India.
More effort is needed to collect, characterize, evaluate and preserve [$snap#Plant*][$melon#Plant*] diversity in genebanks.
