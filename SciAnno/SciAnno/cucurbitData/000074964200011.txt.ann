The effect of three reported biological control agents, [@Ampelomyces quisqualis#Method*], [@Verticillium lecanii#Method*] and [@Sporothrix flocculosa#Method*], was tested against [@cucumber powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]).
Two glasshouse experiments, one in the summer and one in winter/spring were conducted on a semi-commercial scale.
In both experiments, a susceptible and a partially resistant cultivar were used.
In the second experiment, the additional effect of integration of biological control and silicon amendments to the nutrient solution was also assessed.
In both experiments, [@A.quisqualis#Method*] did not control the disease.
[@V.lecanii#Method*] had a small effect on [$powdery mildew#Disease*] in the first experiment but not in the second.
[@S.flocculosa#Method*] gave the best control of [$powdery mildew#Disease*] in both experiments.
In the first experiment, weekly application of [@S.flocculosa#Method*] reduced disease in the partially resistant cultivar to the same level as a treatment in which the [$fungicides#Method*] bupirimate and imazalil were each applied once.
Addition of silicon in the nutrient solution in a concentration of 0.75 mM reduced disease by 10-16%, averaged over all treatments.
There was no interaction between silicon and the biocontrol agents.
Yield was recorded in the second experiment and was significantly increased by the [@fungicide#Method*] treatment compared to the control in the partially resistant cultivar.
Yield in the treatment with [@S.flocculosa#Method*] was not significantly different from the [$fungicide#Method*] treatment in this cultivar.
Silicon had no effect on yield in either cultivar.
