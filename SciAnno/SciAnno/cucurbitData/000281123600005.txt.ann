In vitro morphogenesis of [@Cucumis melo var.flexuosus (L.) Naudin#Plant*] was studied by direct organogenesis.
Induction of adventitious buds was obtained from distal and proximal parts of the cotyledon incubated on Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium containing different concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA) (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg L-1) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.0, 0.1, and 0.5 mg L-1).
The best organogenesis was obtained from the proximal part of the cotyledon on medium containing 0.5 mg L-1 BA and 0.5 mg IAA (88%).
This concentration was used for histological analysis.
Less regeneration was obtained on media containing 1.0 mg BA (75%) or 1.0 mg L-1 and 0.1 mg L-1 IAA (60%).
Plant recovery was much greater from proximal rather than distal explants.
A callus formed on almost every explant on media supplemented with BA.
Histological analyses showed that the formation of early shoot apical meristems was observed in 14-day-old tissues and meristematic structures were seen in 17-day-old tissues.
The first shoot was formed after 21 days.
By this time, the surface was covered with leaf primordia and leaves, mostly without accompanying buds.
