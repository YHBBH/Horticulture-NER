Although it has been reported previously that ethylene plays a critical role in sex determination in [$cucurbit species#Plant*], how the andromonoecy that carries both the male and hermaphroditic flowers is determined in [$watermelon#Plant*] is still unknown.
Here we showed that the [$watermelon#Plant*] gene [@1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 4#Gene*] ([@CitACS4#Gene*]), expressed specifically in car[$pel#Gene*] primordia, determines the andromonoecy in [$watermelon#Plant*].
Among four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and one InDel identified in the coding region of [$CitACS4#Gene*], the C364W mutation located in the conserved box 6 was co-segregated with andromonoecy.
Enzymatic analyses showed that the C364W mutation caused a reduced activity in [$CitACS4#Gene*].
We believe that the reduced [$CitACS4#Gene*] activity may hamper the programmed cell death in stamen primordia, leading to the formation of hermaphroditic flowers.
