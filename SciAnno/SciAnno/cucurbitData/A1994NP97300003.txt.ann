 Studies of the striped   [@cucumber beetle (StCB)#Virus*], [$Acalymma vittata#Virus*] (F.), were conducted to: 1) develop predictive models for time of first colonization of [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts in the spring, and for time of mating and oviposition activity; and 2) develop guidelines for sampling over a range of densities and precision levels.
There was no apparent trend of thermal unit accumulation associated with time of first colonization, and so a degree-day model approach was abandoned.
However, evidence suggests that time Of first colonization is associated with daily mean temperatures greater than 12-degrees-C.
A strong correlation was found between change in number of beetles per plant and the previous days' mean temperatures.
Both mating and oviposition activity were positively influenced by temperature in the range of 18 to 26-degrees-C.
Access to foliage influenced maturation rate but not mating.
Thresholds of mating and oviposition activity were found to be 13-degrees-C and 10-degrees-C, respectively.
A high degree of aggregation of StCB adults (b = 1.986) was described, and sample size estimates for three desired levels of precision under a random sampling design are presented.
