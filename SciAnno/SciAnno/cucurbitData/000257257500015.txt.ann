Ethylene perception has been studied using [@Arabidopsis#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] as model plants during last two decades.
[$Arabidopsis#Plant*] has been an ideal model system for gene identification and subsequent functional analysis of the identified gene.
On the other hand, [$tomato#Plant*] is not only the model of choice to study climacteric fruit ripening but also [$crops#Plant*] of agronomic importance and hence has been at the forefront of the comparative analysis with [$Arabidopsis#Plant*].
A number of fruit development and ripening studies in [$melon#Plant*] have been conducted by many laboratories in the last decade, leading to the accumulation of a great deal of information.
These include [@genetic transformation techniques#Method*], isolation of related genes, physiological information and genetics resources.
The information accumulated has enabled [$melon#Plant*] to carve a niche for itself as an alternative model system for fruit for studies.
In addition, International [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Initiative (ICuGI) was launched 2005, in which [$melon#Plant*] became a model species in [$Cucurbit#Plant*] genomics research.
In next decade, genomic resources including large collection of ESTs, precise maps and so on will be gathered, indicating that [$melon#Plant*] will be an alternative model plant for studying fruit ripening in addition to ethylene perception and signaling.
In this review, we will summarize the information accumulated so far and discuss the perspectives.
