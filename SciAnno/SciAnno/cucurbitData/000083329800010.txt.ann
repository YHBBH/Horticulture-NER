[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) is a partially characterized bipartite closterovirus transmitted by the [$tobacco#Plant*] [$whitefly#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]).
[$CYSDV#Virus*] has emerged as a serious pathogen in southeastern Spain and the Mediterranean Region, causing [@yellowing disease #Disease*]of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
[@Using a modified reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction protocol with gel-extracted dsRNA templates#Method*], fragments of [@CYSDV RNA2#Gene*] were amplified and cloned.
[@Sequence analysis#Method*] of the cloned fragments revealed open reading frames encoding the heat shock protein 70 homolog, two proteins of unknown function (p58 and p9), and the [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) of the virus in a contiguous gene arrangement similar to that of [@lettuce infectious yellows virus (LIYV) RNA2#Gene*].
The complete [@CYSDV CP gene#Gene*] is 756 nt long and encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 28.5 kDa.
A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the [$CYSDV CP gene#Gene*] with those of other closteroviruses revealed significant levels of similarity with [$sweet potato#Plant*] [@chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] and [$LIYV#Virus*] (36 and 27%, respectively), both of which are members of the recently proposed [$Crinivirus genus#Virus*] of closteroviruses.
The complete [$CYSDV CP gene#Gene*] was cloned into a bacterial expression vector, and the resulting fusion protein was purified and used to produce antiserum.
Purified immunoglobulins specifically detected [$CYSDV#Virus*] in infected plant extracts, both in immunoblot and indirect [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*]s with a titer exceeding 2,000 times for both assays.
