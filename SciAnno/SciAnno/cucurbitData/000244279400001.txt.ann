Taxonomy: [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) is a member of [$genus Potyvirus#Virus*], [$family Potyviridae#Virus*].
[$ZYMV#Virus*] is a positive-strand RNA virus.
   Physical properties: Virions are flexuous filaments of 680-730 nm in length and 11-13 nm in diameter, composed of about 2000 subunits of a single 31-kDa protein (calculated).
The genome RNA size is 9.6 kb covalently linked to a viral-encoded protein (the VPg) at the 5' end, and with a 3' poly A tail.
The 5' end of the sequence is AU-rich (69%).
   Viral proteins: The genome is expressed as a polyprotein cleaved by three viral proteases and processed into ten putative mature proteins.
The structural [$coat protein#Gene*] is processed from the carboxyl terminus of the polyprotein and is highly immunogenic.
   Host and symptoms: Natural and experimental infection has been reported mainly in the[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae.
Experimental local lesion hosts include [@Chenopodium amaranticolour#Plant*], [@C.quinoa#Plant*] and [@Gomphrena globosa#Plant*].
Some [$ZYMV#Virus*] strains cause symptomless infection as in [@Ranunculus sardous#Plant*], [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] and [@Sesamum indicum#Plant*].
[$ZYMV#Virus*] causes stunting and major foliar deformation with dark green blisters and mosaics in [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts, eventually developing a filamentous leaf phenotype.
In general, symptoms are severe on [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts and cause dramatic reductions in yields due to severe fruit deformation.
The virus is present in all the plant tissues at relatively high concentrations (c.
0.1 mg/mL of purified virus per 1 g fresh leaf tissue).
The most suitable species for maintenance and purification is [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
   Transmission: [$ZYMV#Virus*] is efficiently transmitted by [$aphids#Virus*] in a non-persistent manner.
The [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) and the helper component-pro[$tea#Plant*]se ([$HC-Pro#Gene*]) are required for [$aphid#Virus*] transmission, through the [$CP#Gene*] DAG motif and the [$HC-Pro#Gene*] KLSC and PTK motifs.
Mechanical transmission is efficient both in the laboratory and naturally.
   Economic importance: [@ZYMV disease#Disease*] is a major constraint in the production of [$cucurbits#Plant*] world-wide.
The virus can cause massive damage (to total loss) to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], and prevents the growth of some [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in certain areas.
Control of [$ZYMV#Virus*] requires the integration of conventional resistance and transgenic breeding along with [$cross-protection#Method*] technologies.
