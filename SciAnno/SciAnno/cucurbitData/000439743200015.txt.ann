In Spain, management of the [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] [$pathogen#Virus*] [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]is strongly dependent on chemicals such as quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides.
In a previous report, widespread resistance to QoI fungicides in populations of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] in south-central Spain was documented, but the molecular mechanisms of resistance remained unclear.
In this work, the role of the RieskeFeS (risp) and the cytochrome b (cytb) gene mutations in QoI resistance of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] were examined.
No point mutations in the risp gene were found in the three QoI-resistant isolates analyzed.
For cytb, [$sequence analysis#Method*] revealed the presence of a G143A substitution that occurs in many QoI-resistant fungi.
This mutation was always detected in QoI-resistant isolates of [@P.xanthii#Virus*]; however, it was also detected in sensitive isolates.
To better understand the role of heteroplasmy for cytb in QoI resistance of [@P.xanthii#Virus*], an allele-specific quantitative [$PCR#Method*] was developed to quantify the relative abundance of the G143 (sensitive) and A143 (resistant) alleles.
High relative abundance of A143 allele (70%) was associated with isolates resistant to QoI fungicides, however, QoI-sensitive isolates also carried the mutated allele in frequencies ranged from 10 to 60% Our data suggest that G143A mutation in cytb is the primary factor involved in QoI resistance of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] but the proportion of G143 and A143 alleles in an isolate may determine its QoI resistance level.
