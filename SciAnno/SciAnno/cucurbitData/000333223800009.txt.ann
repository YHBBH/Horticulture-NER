[@Phytophthora blight#Disease*] is a destructive disease of [$cucurbits#Plant*] affecting the fruit, leaves, crown, and/or roots.
Ten [$cucurbit #Plant*]PIs with known partial resistance to [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] root and [$crown rot#Disease*] were evaluated for resistance to [@Phytophthora fruit rot#Disease*].
Unwounded fruit from field-grown plants of [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] and [$C.pepo#Plant*] were inoculated in a controlled environment at 7 to 10 or 21 to 24 days post-pollination (dpp) with virulent [@P.capsici#Virus*] isolates to examine the effect of fruit age on disease development.
Inoculated fruit were rated for lesion area and [$pathogen#Virus*] mycelial growth 7 days post-inoculation (dpi); fruit length, diameter, and pericarp thickness were also rated.
Two [$C.pepo#Plant*] accessions (PI 169417 and PI 181761) had significant resistance to [$Phytophthora fruit rot#Disease*] at both 7 to 10 dpp and 21 to 24 dpp.
All accessions evaluated displayed reduced disease susceptibility as the fruit aged.
