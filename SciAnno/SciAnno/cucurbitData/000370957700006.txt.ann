To develop a molecular method to identify [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] leaves with signs of [@downy mildew#Disease*], we compared the nucleotide sequences of ribosomal DNA-internal transcribed spacer, cytochrome oxidase II, and beta-tubulin genes of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and [$P.humuli#Virus*] isolates.
Seven [@single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) #Method*]distinguished [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and [$P.humuli#Virus*] based on variations in beta-tubulin sequences, and one specific primer set was designed for further analysis.
Real-time [$PCR#Method*] and high resolution melting analysis showed that the primer set can be used to specifically identify [$P.cubensis #Virus*]in [$cucumber#Plant*] leaves with [$downy mildew#Virus*].
