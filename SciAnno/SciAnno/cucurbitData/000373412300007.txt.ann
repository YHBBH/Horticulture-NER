[@Melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) is seriously affected by [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], the causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*].
Within [$C.melo#Plant*], several genotypes resistant to [$P.cubensis #Virus*]have been described; however, we lack detailed experimental studies focused on deciphering variation in this host-[$pathogen#Virus*] interaction.
The response of 115 accessions of [$C.melo#Plant*] to 8 isolates of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was studied under controlled conditions.
Pathogen isolates with low, medium and high virulence represented 8 distinct pathotypes.
The virulence of isolates expressed by their published pathotypes conformed poorly to their virulence as observed on the [$C.melo#Plant*] accessions in this experiment.
Collectively, 45 different reaction patterns were recorded.
Most [$C.melo#Plant*] accessions (67) were highly susceptible to all isolates.
Two accessions of [@C.melo subsp.agrestis#Plant*] (PI 614174 and PI 614442) were incompletely resistant to all isolates.
The reaction of the remaining 46 accessions was race-specific.
None of screened [$C melo#Plant*] accessions expressed complete resistance to all isolates.
Accession PI 315410 from India was resistant to 5 isolates and incompletely resistant to 2 others.
The reduced development of at least one [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolate was recorded on leaf discs of 17 accessions.
Accessions with incomplete resistance to at least one isolate originated most frequently from India, Zimbabwe and Zambia.
The study: (a) confirmed the race-specificity of interactions between [$C.melo#Plant*] and [$P.cubensis#Virus*], (b) revealed [$C.melo subsp.agrestis#Plant*] as a taxon with potential field resistance to a number of races [$P.cubensis#Virus*], and (c) showed that within [$C.melo#Plant*] populations from India and southern Africa there are accessions completely or incompletely resistant to European races of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
