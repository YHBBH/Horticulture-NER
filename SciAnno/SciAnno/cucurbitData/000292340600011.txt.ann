[@Powdery mildews#Disease*], caused by [$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*] and [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*], are the most common and severe diseases of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in the Mediterranean basin.
In southern Italy, only [$P.xanthii#Plant*] is apparently present.
However, information on its distribution and population biology is scanty, although it would be crucial for a more rational disease control.
Studies addressing physiological races, mating types and [$RAPD analysis#Method*] were carried out on 82 isolates of [$P.xanthii#Plant*] sampled in 34 [$cucurbit #Plant*]fields from Apulia (southern Italy).
A set of eight differential [$melon#Plant*] genotypes were used to discriminate physiological races of the [$fungus#Virus*].
In particular, 13% of the tested isolates belonged to physiological race 2 FR, 30% to race 5, 25% to race 1, 10% to race 3, 5% to race 4, 1% to race 0 and 16% to undetermined races, whereas only one of the two mating types (MAT1-2) of the fungus was detected, and [$RAPD analysis#Method*] showed a quite broad variation within fungal isolates.
