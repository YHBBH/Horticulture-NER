A method was developed [@using a Loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP)#Method*] for detecting [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] in [$cucurbit seeds#Plant*].
The LAMP primers were designed based on the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II RPB140 gene (RPB2) from [$D.bryoniae#Virus*].
Calcein was used as an indicator for the endpoint visual detection of DNA amplification.
The [@LAMP assay#Method*] was conducted in isothermal (65 A degrees C) conditions within 1 h.
The detection threshold of the [$LAMP assay#Method*] was 10 pg of genomic DNA and [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]was detected in 100 % of artificially infested seedlots with 0.05 % [$infe#Plant*]station or greater.
With the [$LAMP assay#Method*], 16 of 60 [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$muskmelon#Plant*] seedlots collected from Xinjang province were determined to be positive for [$D.bryoniae#Virus*].
In contrast, a [$real-time PCR assay #Method*]determined that 11 of the 60 seedlots from Xinjiang province were positive for the [$pathogen#Virus*].
These results showed that the LAMP technique was simple, rapid and well suited for detecting [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]DNA, especially in seed health testing.
