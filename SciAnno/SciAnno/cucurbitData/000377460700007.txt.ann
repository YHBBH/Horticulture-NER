The [@gourd family#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae, contains five [$vegetable crops#Plant*] of worldwide importance, the [$pumpkins#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]), [$watermelons#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]),[$ melons#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and [$cucumbers#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]).
Here is presented a synopsis of the origin and history of these [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
Historical records of the use of [$cucurbits#Plant*] by people take the form of archaeobotanical finds, iconography and literature.
The weight of the evidence indicates that [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
were first cultivated in the Americas at least 10,000 years ago, and that by 1492 ce a number of cultivar-groups of [$pumpkins#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]had been developed by indigenous American peoples.
[$Watermelon#Plant*]s were cultivated in northeastern Africa at least 4,000 years ago, first probably as a source of fresh water.
[$Melon#Plant*]s and [$cucumbers#Plant*] are native to Asia, probably initially cultivated for the use of the young fruits as [$vegetables#Plant*].
[$Melon#Plant*]s spread to eastern Africa at an early date, but [$cucumbers#Plant*] are probably a more recent domesticate and spread westwards later, reaching Europe in early medieval times.
Sequencing of [$cucurbit #Plant*]plant genomes and advances in ancient DNA research offer much promise for obtaining an improved assessment of [$cucurbit crop#Plant*] origins, specifically the genetic constitution and geographical home of ancestral source populations.
Next-generation genomic sequencing, if applied to an appropriate array of archaeological [$cucurbit #Plant*]remains and modern germplasm, could contribute much to the understanding of the history and evolution under domestication of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
