Hydrophobic pollutants, such as [@polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)#Gene*], are detected at high concentrations in plants of the [@Cucurbitaceae family#Plant*], including [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$zucchini#Plant*].
Given that the uptake of these compounds by [$crops#Plant*] can lead to their accumulation in animals via the food chain and that they may have potentially adverse health effects, it is desirable to take appropriate preventative measures.
However, the mechanisms underlying the uptake of these pollutants are still unclear.
We found that the Magda (MG) cultivar of[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] showed high accumulation of [@PCBs#Gene*], especially 2-chlorinated [$PCBs#Gene*], in leaves, stems, and xylem sap compared with the Patty Green (PG) cultivar.
In the MG cultivar, we identified two [@major latex-like proteins (MLPs)#Gene*] produced in roots that are translocated to xylem sap, wherein they bind to [$PCBs#Gene*], and it is assumed that these [@MLPs#Gene*] are associated with the accumulation of [$PCBs#Gene*] in the aerial parts of plants.
These results indicate that [$PCBs#Gene*] are transported by specific mechanisms via the xylem sap.
Collectively, our findings indicate that the expression of [@MLP genes#Gene*] and production of [$MLPs#Gene*] in roots, the excretion of [$MLPs#Gene*] into xylem sap, and the binding of hydrophobic pollutants by [$MLPs#Gene*] are critical steps in the accumulation of hydrophobic pollutants in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
