The occurrence and geographic distribution of [@powdery mildew#Virus*] on [$cucurbits#Plant*] was studied in the Czech Republic, Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, as well as in Turkey and Israel, during the period 1995-2000.
In total, 599 leaf samples with[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] symptoms were collected from [$cucurbits#Plant*] from 166 locations within the Czech Republic; an additional 69 samples were collected from 42 locations elsewhere.
Two [@powdery mildews#Virus*] ([$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*] and [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*]) were identified.
The host range included the cultivated [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*], [$C.sativus#Plant*], [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*], and [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) and several other species.[$P.xanthii#Plant*] was the only[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] [$pathogen#Virus*] found in Spain, Israel, and Turkey.[$P.xanthii#Plant*] and [@G.cichoracearum #Plant*]were detected in the other surveyed countries, occurring in both mixed infections and separately.
In the more northerly latitudes and higher elevations, [$G.cichoracearum #Plant*]is more often the single species.[$G.cichoracearum #Plant*]was the dominant[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] species in the Czech Republic (detected in 98.8% of the locations there); [$P.xanthii#Plant*] was found as the lone species in 1.2% of locations.
At 28.4% of locations, [$G.cichoracearum #Plant*]was found with [$P.xanthii#Plant*] as mixed infections.
The [$hyperparasitic fungus Ampelomyces quisqualis#Virus*] was found in 30% of the samples from the Czech Republic and was also recorded in Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Great Britain.
