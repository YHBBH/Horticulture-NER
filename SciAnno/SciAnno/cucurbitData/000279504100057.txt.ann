We report on the development of novel simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from publicly available [@Cucumis sativus#Plant*] expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and on their transferability among related species.
In total, 533 di- to penta-type SSRs were identified from 6344 [$cucumber#Plant*] ESTs retrieved from GenBank.
Identified SSRs mainly comprised of di- and tri-nucleotide repeats, of which AG and AAG motifs were much abundant.
A total of 392 SSR-containing unigenes (non-redundant ESTs/consensus sequences) were suitable for primer design.
From these, 35 primer pairs were designed as representative samples and 28 were usable markers.
Twenty-six out of 28 usable markers revealed polymorphism among 21 [$cucumber#Plant*] accessions with 2-7 alleles detected (mean = 3.77) and their polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.091 to 0.748 (mean = 0.388).
The polymorphism observed herein partially arose from the null alleles which occurred at the multiple homoeoloci detected by the markers.
Transferability of the 28 [@EST-SSR markers #Method*]was investigated in four other [$cucurbits#Plant*]: [$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$gourd#Plant*] which showed frequency of 92.9%, 57.1%, 53.6% and 60.7%, respectively.
The [$EST-SSR markers #Method*]developed herein will complement the currently available genomic [$SSR markers#Method*] and may be useful for genetic studies in [$cucumber#Plant*] and related species.
