Application of fatty alcohol compounds to rootstock meristems can control rootstock meristematic regrowth, thus decreasing the cost of producing grafted [$watermelon#Plant*] transplants by reducing the labor.
Eight rates of Fair 85 (R) and Off-Shoot T (R), two commercially available fatty alcohol compounds, were applied to the meristem region of [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([@Lagenaria sicereria cv.Emphasis#Virus*]) and interspecific hybrid [$squash #Plant*]([@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] x [@Cucurbita moschata cv.Carnivor#Plant*]) rootstocks to determine the optimal application rate to control regrowth without damaging the remaining plant parts.
A water-only control treatment was also included.
Rootstock [$seedlings#Plant*] were rated for damage and regrowth on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after treatment.
Damage increased and regrowth decreased with increasing rates of fatty alcohol compound.
In addition, a significant compound-by-rate interaction indicated that inert ingredients in the fatty alcohol formulation have an effect on both damage and regrowth.
The optimal treatment rate, e.g., providing at least 95% control of regrowth with less than 10% damage, was found to be between a 5% (Off-Shoot T (R)) In and 6.25% (Fair 85 (R)) fatty alcohol application.
At the optimal treatment rate, no adverse effects to grafting success were observed in the grafting procedure.
