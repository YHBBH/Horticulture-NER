Triazole fungicides, which are sterol demethylation inhibitors, have become the primary systemic fungicides applied to [@cucurbits#Plant*] to control [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] caused by [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*].
Isolates of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]from South Carolina that were never exposed to tebuconazole or exposed for several years were tested for sensitivity to tebuconazole and difenoconazole.
Colony diameters, percentage germination of ascospores and [$conidia#Virus*], and germ tube lengths were measured when isolates were grown on agar amended with 0.1010.0mg/l tebuconazole and 0.011.0mg/l difenoconazole.
All 147 isolates tested were sensitive to tebuconazole and difenoconazole with mean EC50 values of 0.41 and 0.054mg/l, respectively.
Ascospore germination was greater than [$conidia#Virus*] germination on fungicide-amended agar.
Although the length of germ tubes arising from both spore types was reduced by both fungicides, the reduction was greater for ascospore germ tubes than for [$conidia#Virus*] germ tubes.
Because many [$watermelon#Plant*] growers rotate [$crops#Plant*] among fields every two years, local populations of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]have not been exposed repeatedly to tebuconazole.
In addition, growers often apply a rotation of systemic and contact fungicides.
Thus, despite exposure to tebuconazole for up to nine years, isolates of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]from South Carolina remain sensitive to triazole fungicides.
