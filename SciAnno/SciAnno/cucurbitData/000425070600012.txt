Bactrocera cucumis is a lesser known native fruit fly in Australia.
There are 44 reported hosts including cucurbits, papaws and tomatoes with a strong preference for cucurbits.
Adult flies are not attracted to the known male lures such as cuelure, methyl eugenol or zingerone.
They are weakly attracted to protein lures and a recently discovered cucumber volatile.
For this reason, surveillance for this fruit fly remains problematic.
Its range is predominantly coastal and appears to be centred north of Rockhampton in Queensland.
It is known in the Northern Territory, Queensland and in New South Wales north of 29 degrees S latitude.
Internationally, it is not reported in any Pacific countries or other parts of the world.
