[@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], the causal agent of a [@bacterial seedling blight and fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]), has received considerable attention since its first ap[$pea#Plant*]rance in commercial [$watermelon#Plant*] production areas in the United States in 1989.
Subsequently, it has emerged as a serious [$pathogen#Virus*] of [$cucurbitaceous#Plant*] plant species worldwide.
In the major [$cucurbit #Plant*]producing countries of the world, great emphasis has been placed on managing this potentially devastating disease.
Thus far, the most effective strategy for [$BFB#Disease*] management has been exclusion, which relies heavily on rapid and reliable [$pathogen#Virus*] detection.
This review summarises recent progress in the development of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]detection techniques and evaluates their effectiveness as it pertains to [$BFB#Disease*] management.
