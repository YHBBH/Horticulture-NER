Field studies were conducted in 1993, 1994, and 1995 to determine tolerance of seeded and transplanted [@watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum#Plant*] and Nak.] to [$clomazone#Method*], ethalfluralin, and pendimethalin [@using method of stand establishment (direct-seeded vs.transplanted) and time of herbicide application [preplant soil incorporated (PPI), preplant to the surface (PP), or postplant to the surface (POP)] as variables#Method*].
Yield and average fruit weight in plots with [$clomazone#Method*] were equal to or greater than those in control plots for the 3-year study regardless of method of application.
Bleaching and stunting were evident with [$clomazone#Method*] in early-season ratings, but injury was transient and did not affect quality or yield.
Of the three [$herbicides#Method*], ethalfluralin PPI resulted in the greatest injury, stand reduction, and yield reduction of the three [$herbicides#Method*].
Pendimethalin (PPI, PP, or POP) reduced yield of direct-seeded but not of transplanted [$watermelon#Plant*].
Chemical names used: 2-[(-2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4, 4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolidinone ([$clomazone#Method*]); N-ethyl-N-(2-methyl-2-propenyl) -2,6-dinitro-4- (trifluoromethyl) benzenamine (ethalfluralin); N-(1-ethylopropyl)-3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitrobenzenamine (pendimethalin).
