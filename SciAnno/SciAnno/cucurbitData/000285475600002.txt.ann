Production of[@ summer squash#Plant*], [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], can be severely limited by viral [$pathogens#Virus*] and[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
Resistance has been introgressed from[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata, and resistant hybrids have been commercially deployed.
Our objective was to assess genetic affinities of such hybrids with susceptible, open-pollinated [$cocozelle#Plant*] and [$zucchini#Plant*] cultivars, and two disease-resistant lines derived from six generations of backcrossing to a susceptible [$zucchini#Plant*] cultivar.
Amplified fragment length polymorphism ([$AFLP#Method*]) Eco RI/Mse I primer combinations were employed and, based on the resulting polymorphic bands, genetic similarities were estimated, and an unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) [$cluster analysis#Method*] was conducted.
The open-pollinated [$cocozelle#Plant*] cultivars clustered with the resistant hybrids.
The hybrids had greater similarities with one another than did the open-pollinated cultivars.
The [$zucchini#Plant*] cultivars and their resistant backcross lines formed their own exclusive cluster.
However, the resistant backcross lines showed less than 0.80 similarity with their recurrent parent.
As the chromosome number of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] is high (2n = 2x = 40) and the resistances are inherited monogenically and oligogenically, these results, after six generations of backcrossing, cannot be explained by classical genetic linkage.
