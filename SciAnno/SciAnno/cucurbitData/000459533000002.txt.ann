[@Bottle gourd#Plant*] is an important [$cucurbit crop#Plant*] worldwide.
To provide more available [$molecular markers#Method*] for this [$crop#Plant*], a [@bioinformatic approach was employed to develop insertion-deletions (InDels) markers in bottle gourd based on restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) data#Method*].
A total of 892 Indels were predicted, with the length varying from 1 bp to 167 bp.
Single-nucleotide InDels were the predominant types of InDels.
To validate these InDels, [$PCR#Method*] primers were designed from 162 loci where InDels longer than 2 bp were predicated.
A total of 112 InDels were found to be polymorphic among 9 [$bottle gourd#Plant*] accessions under investigation.
The rate of prediction accuracy was thus at a high level of 72.7%.
DNA fingerprinting for 4 cultivars were performed using 8 selected Indels markers, demonstrating the usefulness of these markers.
