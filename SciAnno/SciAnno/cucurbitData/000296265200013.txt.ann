[@Zucchini squash#Plant*] is host to [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), a member of the [$genus Crinivirus#Virus*], and [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]), a member of the genus [$Ipomovirus#Virus*], both transmitted by the [$whitefly Bemisia tabaci#Virus*].
Field observations suggest the ap[$pea#Plant*]rance of new symptoms observed on leaves of [$zucchini squash#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] when both viruses were present.
When infected during controlled experiments with [$CYSDV#Virus*] only, [$zucchini#Plant*] plants showed no obvious symptoms and the virus titer decreased between 15 and 45 days postinoculation (dpi), after which it was no longer detected.
[$CVYV#Virus*] caused inconspicuous symptoms restricted to vein clearing on some of the apical leaves and the virus accumulated progressively between 15 and 60 dpi.
Similar accumulations of virus followed single inoculations with the [$potyvirus#Virus*] [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) and plants showed severe stunting, leaf deformation, and mosaic yellowing.
However, in mixed infections with [$CYSDV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*], intermediate leaves showed chlorotic mottling which evolved later to rolling, brittleness, and complete yellowing of the leaf lamina, with exception of the veins.
No consistent alteration of [$CVYV#Virus*] accumulation was detected but the amounts of [$CYSDV#Virus*] increased approximate to 100-fold and remained detectable at 60 dpi.
Such synergistic effects on the titer of the crinivirus and symptom expression were not observed when co-infected with [$ZYMV#Virus*].
