During the year 2002, two new diseases with unknown etiologies were detected in [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Israel.
One disease was detected in [$squash #Plant*]fields throughout the country, while the second appeared in a single [$watermelon#Plant*] plot in the south, just outside the city of Elat.
The infected [$watermelon#Plant*] plot was eradicated, but nonetheless the new disease spread throughout the country and today it is present in all the [$watermelon#Plant*] production areas.
Both diseases were associated with elevated [$whitefly#Virus*] populations.
Indeed, it was found that both are transmitted only by [$whiteflies#Virus*], and are incited by two [$begomoviruses#Virus*].
Both viruses were cloned and sequenced, and were identified as [$Watermelon#Plant*] [$chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]) and [$Squash leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([$SLCV#Virus*]).
The host range of the Israeli [$WmCSV#Virus*] isolate ([@WmCSV-IL#Virus*]) was determined and resembles the host range of the three other known [$WmCSV#Virus*] isolates (from Yemen, Sudan, and Iran), but with a few differences.
Although no genetic resistance to [$WmCSV#Virus*] was observed in cultivated [$watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum#Plant*].
& Nakai], resistance to the virus was found in a wild relative, colocynth ([$Citrullus colocynthis (L)#Plant*] Schrader).
[$Nucleotide sequence comparisons#Method*] revealed that [$WmCSV-IL#Virus*] is highly homologous to other [$WmCSV#Virus*] isolates, with the highest homology (nearly identical) to the isolate from Sudan.
[$SLCV#Virus*]-IL host range was determined as well, and was also found to be similar to other [$SLCV#Virus*] isolates.
However, following genome sequencing, it was found that due to two separate point mutations, two viral open reading frames (ORF) were altered.
The AC2 ORF was extended by 129 nucleotides, while the BV1 ORF was reduced by 99 nucleotides.
