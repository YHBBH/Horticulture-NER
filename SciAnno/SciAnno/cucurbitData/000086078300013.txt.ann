The potential for outcrossing, occurrence of oospores, and inheritance of mefenoxam sensitivity was assessed in naturally occurring populations of [@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*].
Between 1997 and 1998, 14 farms were sampled, with 473 isolates recovered from [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts and 30 from bell pepper.
The A1 and A2 compatibility types were recovered in a roughly 1:1 ratio in 8 of 14 farms with sample sizes larger than 15.
In 1997, one isolate was designated as insensitive and four as sensitive to mefenoxam.
In 1998, 55% of the 498 isolates sampled were sensitive, 32% were intermediate, and 13% were fully insensitive to mefenoxam.
In vitro characterization of mefenoxam sensitivity was conducted by crossing field isolates.
[@Chi-square analysis#Method*] of crosses between sensitive, intermediately sensitive, and insensitive isolates indicate that mefenoxam Insensitivity segregated as an incompletely dominant trait unlinked to compatibility type (P = 0.05).
Oospores were observed in diseased [$cucurbit#Plant*] fruit from four farms in 1998, and 223 oospore progeny were recovered from a single diseased [$cucumber#Plant*].
AII six mefenoxam sensitivity-compatibility type combinations were present in these oospore progeny and within single fields.
Based on these findings, we conclude that oospores likely play a role in the survival of [@P, capsici#Virus*] and that sexual recombination may significantly influence population structure.
