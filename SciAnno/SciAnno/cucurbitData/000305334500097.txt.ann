[@Watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus (thumb.) Matsum and Nakai#Plant*]] cultivar "Charleston gray" was grafted onto three rootstocks:[@ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] and [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] x [@Cucurbita moshata#Plant*].
Non-grafted plants were used as controls.
Two methods of grafting were tested: tube grafting and hole insertion grafting.
It was found that the second method resulted in higher survival percentage of grafted plants.
Both grafted and non-grafted plants were grown in soil in a randomized complete block design with four replications, each consisting of ten plants.
As compared to the controls, grafted plants showed better vegetative growth.
However, grafting did not exert any significant influence on fruit quality and yield.
