[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus* ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) has been present in greenhouse-grown [$cucumber#Plant*] in Spain since 1992.
However, in the autumn of 2000 [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) was introduced, leading to mixed infections of both [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]-transmitted viruses.
The temporal and spatial spread of disease symptoms were monitored in experimental plastic-covered greenhouses during six consecutive [$cucumber#Plant*] plantings from 2000 to 2002.
Using [@linear regression analysis#Method*] of 46 disease-progress curves, the Gompertz model best described the [$CYSDV#Virus*] epidemics in 2000, whereas the logistic model best described the development of [$CYSDV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*] epidemics in 2001 and 2002.
The fitted models were used to calculate the amount of degree Celsius-days at half-maximum infection in the greenhouses (degrees D-0.5).
After [@multiple regression analysis#Method*], 56% of the variation in degrees D-0.5 of [$CYSDV#Virus*] was related to the numbers of [$whiteflies#Virus*] infesting the [@cucumber crops#Plant*], and was independent of the mean temperatures in the greenhouses.
In contrast, 76% of the variation in degrees D-0.5 of [$CVYV#Virus*] was related to both the numbers of vectors present and maximum temperature.
Symptom expression in [$cucumbers#Plant*] mechanically inoculated with [$CVYV#Virus*] was most prevalent when plants were grown at regimes of at least 28 degrees C day temperature.
According to analysis of spread using Taylor's power law, beta-binomial distribution fitting, and the ordinary runs test, the prevalence of [$CVYV#Virus*] showed significant overdispersion, whereas that of [$CYSDV#Virus*] did not.
The chi(2) test of independence and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used to measure co-occurrence and covariation, respectively, during the first half of the cultivation period.
These results showed that the two diseases were not associated.
