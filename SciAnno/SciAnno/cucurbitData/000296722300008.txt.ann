To elucidate the genetic and biochemical regulation of elicitor-induced p-coumaraldehyde accumulation in plants, we undertook a multifaceted approach to characterize the metabolic flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway via the characterization and chemical analysis of the metabolites in the p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohol branches of this pathway.
Here, we report the identification and characterization of four [@cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs)#Gene*] from [@cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) with low activity toward p-coumaraldehyde yet exhibiting significant activity toward other phenylpropanoid hydroxycinnamaldehydes.
As part of this analysis, we identified and characterized the activity of a hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A: shikimate [@hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) #Gene*]capable of utilizing shikimate and p-coumaroyl-coenzyme A to generate p-coumaroyl shikimate.
Following pectinase treatment of [$cucumber#Plant*], we observed the rapid accumulation of p-coumaraldehyde, likely the result of low aldehyde reductase activity (i.e.
alcohol dehydrogenase in the reverse reaction) of [@CsCAD#Gene*] enzymes on p-coumaraldehyde.
In parallel, we noted a concomitant reduction in the activity of [@CsHCT#Gene*].
Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the up-regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway upon abiotic stress greatly enhances the overall p-coumaryl alcohol [$bran#Plant*]ch of the pathway.
The data presented here point to a role for [$CsHCT#Gene*] (as well as, presumably, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase) as a control point in the regulation of the coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol branches of this pathway.
This mechanism represents a potentially evolutionarily conserved process to efficiently and quickly respond to biotic and abiotic stresses in [$cucurbit plants#Plant*], resulting in the rapid lignification of affected tissues.
