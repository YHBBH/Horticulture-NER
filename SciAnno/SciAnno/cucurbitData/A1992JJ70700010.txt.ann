 Subpopulations of an isolate of [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*] pathotype 5, which is virulent to both [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) and [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), were maintained on each host for 18 generations.
After each generation, each subpopulation was inoculated to both [$squash #Plant*]and [$muskmelon#Plant*], and the subsequent sporulation rate on each host was monitored as an indicator of virulence.
The subpopulation maintained on [$muskmelon#Plant*] showed a 99.7% reduction in sporulation rate on [$squash #Plant*]and a 226.1% increase in sporulation rate on [$muskmelon#Plant*] from generations five through 18.
Sporulation on [$squash #Plant*]in this subpopulation returned to the original level after two generations of continuous culture on that host.
This study illustrates the important effects of [$cucurbit #Plant*]host species in the selection of virulence factors that affect sporulation by this [$pathogen#Virus*] and provides insight into the occurrence of different pathotypes in [$cucurbit #Plant*]production areas from year to year.
