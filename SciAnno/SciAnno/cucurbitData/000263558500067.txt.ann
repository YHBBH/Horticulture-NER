The first [@SSR-based genetic linkage map#Method*] of [@C.moschata#Plant*] was created by integrating the maps of two F, populations with one common parent developed from the crosses Waltham Butternut (WB) x Nigerian Local (NL) and ZHOU (a hull-less type) x WB.
This integrated C.
moschata map comprises 205 [$SSR markers#Method*] and 2 morphological traits (Gr and n).
The map is composed of 27 linkage groups with a marker density of 7 cM.
Comparison of the [$C.moschata#Plant*] map and the published [$C.pepo#Plant*] map revealed a high level of macro-synteny.
Seventy-one common [$SSR markers#Method*] between [$C.moschata#Plant*] and [$C.pepo#Plant*] are located in homologous linkage groups.
These markers representing orthologous loci in general have conserved orders and similar genetic distances.
Four [$SSR markers#Method*] were mapped in non-homologous linkage groups.
They may represent different members of multi-gene families, chromosomal rearrangements and paralogs.
The comparative mapping of [$C.moschata#Plant*] and [$C.pepo#Plant*] reported here will be useful for further studies on [$Cucurbit#Plant*] evolution, [$gene isolation#Method*], and breeding
