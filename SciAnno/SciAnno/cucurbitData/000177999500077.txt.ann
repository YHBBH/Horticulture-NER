Based on the reactions to [@Verticillium dahliae#Virus*] infection of nineteen [@tomato#Plant*] and thirty-three [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*], previously selected as rootstocks for commercial cultivars, ten combinations (rootstock-scion) of [$tomato#Plant*] and thirteen combinations of [$cucurbits#Plant*] were evaluated under greenhouse conditions for their resistance to [$Verticillium wilt#Disease*].
[$Tomato#Plant*] plants were tested again races 1 and 2 of the [$pathogen#Virus*] while [$cucurbits#Plant*] were inoculated with one isolate that originated from an infected [$cucumber#Plant*] plant.
Based on foliar symptoms, three of the [$cucurbit#Plant*] combinations were identified as resistant, four moderately susceptible, three susceptible and three very susceptible.
Three of the [$tomato#Plant*] combinations were resistant to race 1 of [@V.dahliae#Virus*], five susceptible and two very susceptible, while all four combinations tested were equally susceptible to race 2.
All the above grafts will be evaluated for [$Verticillium wilt#Disease*] resistance under field conditions.
