[@Gummy stem blight#Disease*] is a major disease of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] caused by [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] ([$anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum#Virus*]).
Previously, we used [$random amplified polymorphic DNA#Method*] ([$RAPD#Method*]) profiles and specific [$PCR#Method*] primers to sort a worldwide collection of isolates of [@D.bryoniae#Virus*] into two major genotypes, [$RAPD#Method*] Group (RG) I and RG II.
A recently developed [$real-time PCR#Method*] assay for [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]specific only for isolates with the RG I genotype has limitations in practical disease diagnosis.
The objective of the present study was to develop a new set of primers and Tay Man probe in conjunction with [$real-time PCR#Method*] to detect both genotypes.
This new Didymella detection system generated strong Ct values to a worldwide collection of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]including 105 RG I, 13 RG II and 7 unassigned isolates.
This broad spectrum and specific [$real-time PCR#Method*] system could be used in routine seed and plant health diagnosis for [$D.bryoniae#Virus*].
