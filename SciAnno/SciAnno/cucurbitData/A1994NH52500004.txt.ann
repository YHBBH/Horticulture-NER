 We examined the reactions of [@Cucurbita spp#Plant*] to [$Fusarium#Virus*] [$root rot#Disease*] by evaluating disease severity.
[$Cucurbit#Plant*] plants exhibited different susceptibilities to isolates of [@Fusarium solani f sp cucurbitae race 1#Virus*].
Cultivars 'Suzunari-nishiki' and 'Miyako' of [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] were more susceptible than [$C pepo#Plant*] 'Zam [$Squash#Plant*]' and [$C moschata#Plant*] 'Yashiro-yon-go'.
The aggressiveness of the isolates to [$cucurbits#Plant*] also varied.
Perithecia were formed in some dual cultures between field isolates.
All perithecia were fertile.
The possibilities for the emergence of new races or virulent strains are discussed.
