The pathogenicity of 35 [@Fusarium solani#Virus*] isolates obtained from diseased leaves of greenhouse-grown [@Phalaenopsis plants#Plant*] in Taiwan was tested on different [@orchids#Plant*], including [@Phalaenopsis sp.#Plant*], [@Cymbidium spp.#Plant*], [@Oncidium sp.#Plant*], [@Dendrobium sp.#Plant*]and [@Cattleya sp.#Plant*], [@plus pea#Plant*] ([$Pisum sativum#Plant*]), [@chrysanthemum#Plant*] ([@Chrysanthemum indicum#Plant*]) and [$cucurbit #Plant*][[$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and [@cucmber#Plant*] ([$C.sativus#Plant*])] plants.
Isolates of [$F.solani#Virus*] from [@Phalaenopsis spp.#Plant*]caused severe leaf yellowing on [@Phalaenopsis#Plant*] and mild symptoms on [$Cymbidium spp.#Plant*], but no visual symptoms on [$Oncidium sp.#Plant*], [$Dendrobium sp.#Plant*], [$Cattleya sp.#Plant*], [$pea#Plant*], [$chrysanthemum#Plant*] or [$melon#Plant*].
[$Fusarium solani#Virus*] isolates collected from [$Phalaenopsis#Plant*], [$pea#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] were molecularly characterized by [@internal transcribed spacer (ITS), intergenic spacer (IGS) and beta-tubulin gene analyses#Method*].
[@Phylogenetic trees #Method*]constructed by distance and parsimony methods indicated that isolates from [$Phalaenopsis#Plant*] were grouped into one type based on ITS, IGS and beta-tubulin sequences with high bootstrap value (> 84%) support, compared to 'formae speciales' of [$F.solani#Virus*] from the other hosts.
These analyses show that isolates of [$F.solani#Virus*] from [$Phalaenopsis#Plant*] are distinct from [$F.solani#Virus*] isolates from other hosts in Taiwan.
Therefore, it is proposed that [$F.solani#Virus*] isolates that incite [$Phalaenopsis#Plant*] leaf yellowing be designated [@F.solani f.sp.phalaenopsis#Virus*].
