Serological survey of virus in [@cucurbit species#Plant*] in the Lower Middle Sao Francisco River Basin, Brazil
   Aiming to get information about the virus that most frequently infects [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] of the species [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*], [$Citrullus spp.#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] spp., [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], [@Lagenaria sp.#Plant*], [$Momordica charantia#Plant*] and also some F1 hybrids of [@C.lanatus#Plant*] with [@C.lanatus var#Plant*].
citroides in irrigated areas of Petrolina-PE and Juazeiro-BA, experimental and farming areas were surveyed in the first and second half of each year (2005 to 2007).
The samples were tested by indirect [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]) against antisera specific for [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*], type [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), and by Agar Double Diffusion against antiserum specific for [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]) at the Plant [$Virus#Virus*] Laboratory of the Federal University of Ceara.
Leaf samples from 967 plants were analyzed and 608 of them were infected.
Among 125 samples from symptomless plants, 42 allow replication.
[$PRSV-W#Virus*] was predominant, followed by [$WMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*], and mixed infections occurred in all infected species.
[$CMV#Virus*] was detected only in one sample and [$SqMV#Virus*] was not found.
This is an indication that a breeding program for virus resistance in [$cucurbit species#Plant*] in the region must consider the three [$potyviruses#Virus*].
