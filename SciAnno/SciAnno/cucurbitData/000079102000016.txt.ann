The [@cucurbits#Plant*] translocate the galactosyl-sucrose oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose, therefore, alpha-galactosidase (alpha-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.22) is expected to function as the initial enzyme of photoassimilate catabolism.
However, the previously described alkaline alpha-galactosidase is specific for the tetrasaccharide stachyose, leaving raffinose catabolism in these tissues as an enigma.
In this paper we report the partial purification and characterization of three alpha-galactosidases, including a novel alkaline alpha-galactosidase (form I) from [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) fruit tissue.
The form I enzyme showed preferred activity with raffinose and significant activity with stachyose.
Other unique characteristics of this enzyme, such as weak product inhibition by galactose (in contrast to the other alpha-galactosidases, which show stronger product inhibition), also impart physiological significance.
Using raffinose and stachyose as substrates in the assays, the activities of the three alpha-galactosidases (alkaline form I, alkaline form II, and the acid form) were measured at different stages of fruit development.
The form I enzyme activity increased during the early stages of ovary development and fruit set, in contrast to the other alpha-galactosidase enzymes, both of which declined in activity during this period.
In the mature, sucrose-accumulating mesocarp, the alkaline form I enzyme was the major cu-galactosidase present.
We also observed hydrolysis of raffinose at alkaline conditions in enzyme extracts from other [$cucurbit#Plant*] sink tissues, as well as from young [@Coleus blumei#Plant*] leaves.
Our results suggest different physiological roles for the alpha-galactosidase forms in the developing [$cucurbit#Plant*] fruit, and show that the newly discovered enzyme plays a physiologically significant role in photoassimilate partitioning in [$cucurbit#Plant*] sink tissue.
