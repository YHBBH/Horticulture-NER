[@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] causes great losses in [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*] worldwide.
In cool temperate climates of northern Europe or North America overwintering as active [$mycelium#Virus*] is not possible, because all hosts so far reported there are summer annuals.
Oospores have not yet been found in these regions under field conditions.
The only perennial member of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] found naturally in central and northern Europe is [@Bryonia dioica#Plant*].
To date this plant has not been recorded as a host for [$downy mildews#Virus*], but our infection trials demonstrate that [$P.cubensis #Virus*]is able to infest this plant.
Amplification and sequencing of the ITS rDNA confirmed the observed [@downy mildew disease#Disease*] on [$B.dioica#Plant*] as [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
From these findings, the possibility that [$P.cubensis #Virus*]may be able to overwinter on this perennial host cannot be excluded.
Whether or not [$B.dioica#Plant*] plays a part in the epidemology of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]in Europe requires evaluation by further studies.
