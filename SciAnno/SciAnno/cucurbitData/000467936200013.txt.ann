Symptomatic and non-symptomatic leaf samples of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] plants were collected from three locations (Al-Ahsa in the East, Jizan in the South and Tabuk in the North) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2013-2014.
The detection of [$begomovirus#Virus*] infection was commenced [@with serological assay, rolling circle amplification and PCR amplification with universal begomovirus primers#Method*].
The [$zucchini#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] samples tested positive for the presence of [$begomovirus#Virus*] infection in 53 and 39.6%, and 54.5 and 41.5% samples using serological and [$PCR#Method*]-based detection, respectively.
Based upon the core [$coat protein#Gene*] sequence, the full-length genomes of DNA-A and DNA-B were amplified and subsequently sequenced.
The [$sequence analysis#Method*] revealed that the two clones of DNA-A shared 96.9% nucleotide (nt) sequence identity with each other while they shared 95.9-98.4% nt sequence identity with [$watermelon#Plant*] [$chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]) isolates reported so far.
Similarly, the two DNA-B clones showed 91.8% mutual nt sequence identity, while sharing 95.2-95.5% nt sequence identity with all other reported DNA-B sequences.
The phylogenetic dendrogram grouped both DNA-A clones into separate sub-groups, suggesting that both isolates were introduced separately into Saudi Arabia.
The identification of [$WmCSV#Virus*] from [$zucchini#Plant*] in Saudi Arabia and other hosts in the neighbouring countries suggests that this virus is becoming an emerging threat to [$cucurbits#Plant*] in this region.
