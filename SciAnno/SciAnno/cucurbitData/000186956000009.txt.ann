The [@coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene of [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) was amplified by reverse transcription - [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]).
The amplicon,vas cloned in pGEM-T, sequenced and subcloned into a bacterial expression vector (pQE-31).
The recombinant [$CYSDV#Virus*] [$CP#Gene*] was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag, purified by affinity chromatography yielding 8 mg native protein per liter of bacterial culture, and used as an antigen to produce [$CYSDV#Virus*] [$CP#Gene*] antiserum in a rabbit.
The resulting antiserum was successfully assayed in [@tissue blot immunoassay#Method*] [@TBIA#Method*]), [@dot blot immunoassay#Method*] ([@DBIA#Method*]), indirect [$ELISA#Method*] and [@DAS-ELISA#Method*], with a titer of about 10(3) for all methods.
[$TBIA#Method*] was very specific and showed the virus localization in the phloem tissue and is recommended for large-scale [$surveys#Method*].
