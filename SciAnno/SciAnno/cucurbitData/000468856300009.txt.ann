[@Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), an emerging [$tobamovirus#Virus*], has caused serious disease outbreaks to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in several countries, including the United States.
Although [$CGMMV#Virus*] is seed borne, the mechanism of its transmission from a contaminated seed to germinating seedling is still not fully understood, and the most suitable seed health assay method has not been well established.
To evaluate the mechanism of seed transmissibility, using highly contaminated [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds collected from [$CGMMV#Virus*]-infected experimental plants, bioassays were conducted in a greenhouse through seedling grow-out and by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*].
Through natural seedling grow-out, we did not observe seed transmission of [$CGMMV#Virus*] to germinating [$seedlings#Plant*].
However, efficient transmission of [$CGMMV#Virus*] was observed using bioassays on [$melon plants#Plant*] through [$mechanical inoculation#Method*] of seed extract prepared from [$CGMMV#Virus*]-contaminated seeds.
Understanding the seed borne property and the ease of mechanical transmission of [$CGMMV#Virus*] from a contaminated seed to seedling is an important finding.
In comparative evaluation of various laboratory techniques for seed health assays, we found that [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification were the most sensitive and reliable methods to detect [$CGMMV#Virus*] on [$cucurbit seeds#Plant*].
Because [$CGMMV#Virus*] is a seed borne and highly contagious virus, a new infection might not result in a natural seedling grow-out; it could occur through mechanical transmission from contaminated seeds.
Therefore, a sensitive seed health test is necessary to ensure [$CGMMV#Virus*]-free seed lots are used for planting.
