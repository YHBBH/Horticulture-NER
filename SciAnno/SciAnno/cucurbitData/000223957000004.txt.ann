[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) routinely causes significant losses in [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) and [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]).
[$ZYMV#Virus*] resistances from the [$cucumber#Plant*] population 'TMG1' and the [$melon#Plant*] plant introduction (PI) 414723 show different modes of inheritance and their genetic relationships are unknown.
We used [@molecular markers#Method*] tightly linked to [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistances from [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] for comparative mapping.
A 5-kb genomic region (YCZ-5) cosegregating with the zym locus of [$cucumber#Plant*] was cloned and sequenced to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels distinguishing alleles from [$ZYMV#Virus*]-resistant (TMG1) and susceptible (Straight 8) [$cucumbers#Plant*].
A low-copy region of the YCZ-5 clone was hybridized to bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of [$melon#Plant*] and a 180-kb contig assembled.
One end of this [$melon#Plant*] contig was mapped in [$cucumber#Plant*] and cosegregated with [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance, demonstrating that physically linked regions in [$melon#Plant*] show genetic linkage in [$cucumber#Plant*].
However the YCZ-5 region segregated independently of [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance loci in two [$melon#Plant*] families.
These results establish that these sources of [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistances from [$cucumber#Plant*] TMG1 and [$melon#Plant*] PI414723 are likely non-syntenic.
