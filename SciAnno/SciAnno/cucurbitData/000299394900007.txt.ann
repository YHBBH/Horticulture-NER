Differential sensitivity to boscalid in conidia and ascospores of [@Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] and frequency of boscalid-insensitive isolates in South Carolina.
Plant Dis.
96:228-234.
   Since 2003, a 2:1 mixture of the fungicides boscalid and pyraclostrobin (Pristine) has been used widely on [$watermelon#Plant*] and other [$cucurbits#Plant*], primarily to control [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] caused by [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*].
Several isolates of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]that were insensitive to boscalid at 10 mg/liter were found in a [$watermelon#Plant*] research plot in South Carolina in 2008.
In total, 201 isolates collected between 1998 and 2009 were tested for sensitivity to boscalid by determining percentage germination of ascospores and [$conidia#Virus*] on media amended with boscalid at 0.01 to 10.0 mg/liter.
All 31 isolates collected in 1998, 2002, or 2005 were sensitive to boscalid.
Of the 170 isolates collected in or after 2006, 84.7% were insensitive to boscalid, including 19 of 30 isolates recovered from greenhouse-grown [$seedlings#Plant*].
The oldest insensitive isolates were obtained in 2006 from a greenhouse and in 2008 from a commercial field.
Ascospores were less sensitive to boscalid than [$conidia#Virus*].
With boscalid at 1.0 mg/liter, 22.4% of ascospores but only 4.1% of [$conidia#Virus*] of 31 sensitive isolates germinated.
Similarly, a mean of 68.6% of the ascospores and 54.1% of the [$conidia#Virus*] of 120 insensitive isolates germinated at 1.0 and 10.0 mg/liter.
The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values based on ascospore germination were two to three times higher than values based on [$conidia#Virus*] germination.
The significance of miscalculating EC50 values by considering only [$conidia#Virus*] was demonstrated in a greenhouse experiment.
Twelve isolates that were sensitive, moderately insensitive, or highly insensitive based on [$conidia#Virus*] germination did not differ in relative virulence on boscalid-treated [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] when inoculum suspensions comprised ascospores alone or ascospores and [$conidia#Virus*].
This is the first report of differential sensitivity to a fungicide between [$conidia#Virus*] and ascospores in [$D.bryoniae#Virus*].
Because [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]produces [$conidia#Virus*] and ascospores on diseased hosts, both spore types should be used when calculating EC50 values for boscalid.
