[@Cucurbits#Plant*] are grown throughout the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan as summer and winter [$crops#Plant*].
Plants having mosaic, mottling, chlorosis and leaf distortion symptoms were frequently found in most of the [$cucurbit#Plant*] fields during the survey.
Using [@dot immunobinding assay#Method*], [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) and [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) were found infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*].
[$CGMMV#Virus*] was widespread, infecting 46.9% of the samples tested followed by [$ZYMV#Virus*] (14.8%), [$WMV#Virus*] (12.5%) and [$PRSV#Virus*] (7.8%).
Multiple infections were common with 42% of the samples being infected with two viruses and 8% with three viruses.
The nucleotide sequences of the [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) genes of these four viruses were determined and deduced amino acid sequence comparisons revealed 88.3-99% similarity of the [$ZYMV#Virus*]-Pak isolate with other isolates of [$ZYMV#Virus*] reported worldwide.
The amino acid sequence identity of Pakistani isolates of [$WMV#Virus*], [$CGMMV#Virus*] and [$PRSV#Virus*] ranged from 96.8 to 98.4%, 98.1 to 99.4% and 79.3 to 84.2%, respectively, with other isolates reported elsewhere.
Little variability was observed in the sequences of [$WMV#Virus*] and [$CGMMV#Virus*].
[$ZYMV#Virus*]-Pak was very close to the USA isolate, and the [$PRSV#Virus*]-Pak isolate was close to Indian isolates of [$PRSV#Virus*] possibly reflecting the geographical relationship between these isolates.
