[@Cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$CPM#Virus*]), which is caused most frequently by two obligate erysiphaceous ectoparasites ([@Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*], [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*]), Occurs on field and glasshouse [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide.
We review the current state of understanding of variation for [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of these two [$pathogens#Virus*] at the pathotype and race levels, and propose for use by the international [$CPM#Virus*] research, breeding, seed and production communities: 1) two sets of differential [$cucurbit#Plant*] genotypes for the identification of [$CPM#Virus*] pathotypes and races, and 2) an objective, efficient, uniform, comprehensive coded system for meaningful, concise designation of [$CPM#Virus*] pathotypes (sextet code) and races (septet code).
The proposed set of pathotype differentials includes six genotypes, three genera ([$Cucumis#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*], [$Citrullus#Plant*]), and five species.
The proposed the set of [$CPM#Virus*] race differentials includes 21 genotypes of a single species, [$Cucumis melo L#Plant*].
The race set can determine the race identity of either [$pathogen#Virus*] species when isolated from the [$cucurbit#Plant*] genera included in the pathotype differential set.
