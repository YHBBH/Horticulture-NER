An improved method for particle [@Crinivirus#Virus*].[@Particle measurem#Method*]ents were conducted with a CCD-72S solid state camera, which was interfaced with a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope, and analyzed [@using the analysis 2.1 Image Analysis Software#Method*].
In comparisons of [@specimen preparation methods#Method*], [@the leaf dip method#Method*] is more representative and reproducible than the antibody capture method or preparation from purified virions.
Particle length (nm) ranges of [$whitefly#Virus*]-transmitted criniviruses are: [@Abutilon yellows virus#Virus*] ([@AYV#Virus*]), 800 to 850; [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), 750 to 800; [@Lettuce chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([@LCV#Virus*]), 800 to 850; [@Lettuce infectious yellows virus#Virus*] ([$LIYV#Virus*]), 700 to 750; [@Tomato chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([@ToCV#Virus*]), 800 to 850; and [@Tomato infectious chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([@TICV#Virus*]), 850 to 900.
