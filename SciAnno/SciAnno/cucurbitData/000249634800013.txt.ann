[@Based on spore morphology, appressorium development, sequence similarities of the rDNA, and similarities in amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)#Method*], it has been proposed that [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], [@C.trifolii#Virus*], [@C.lindemuthianum#Virus*], and [@C.malvarum #Virus*]represent a single phylogenetic species, [$C.orbiculare#Virus*].
In the current study, the phylogenetic relationship among isolates in the [@C orbiculare#Virus*] species complex was reassessed.
In all, 72 isolates of [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] from cultivated [$cucurbit#Plant*] or [$weed hosts#Plant*], [$C.trifolii#Virus*] from [$alfalfa#Plant*], [$C.lindemuthianum#Virus*] from green [$bean#Plant*], and [$C.malvarum #Virus*]from prickly sida ([$Sida spinosa#Plant*]) were examined for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [@restriction fragment length polymorphisms#Gene*] ([$RFLPs#Gene*]), [$RFLPs#Gene*] and sequence variation of a 900-bp intron of the glutamine synthetase gene and a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, and vegetative compatibility.
In addition, host specificity was examined in foliar inoculations on [$cucurbit#Plant*], [$bean#Plant*], and [$alfalfa#Plant*] hosts.
Inoculations also were conducted on [$cucumber#Plant*] fruit.
Genetically distinct isolates, based on vegetative compatibility, within the species complex ([$C.orbiculare#Virus*], [$C.trifolii#Virus*], and [@C.malvarum#Virus*]) had an identical mtDNA haplotype (haplotype A) when examined with each of three different restriction enzymes.
Isolates of [$C.lindemuthianum#Virus*] had a very similar mtDNA haplotype to haplotype A, with a single polymorphism detected with the enzyme HaeIII.
The four species represent a phylogenetically closely related group based on a statistical analysis of the 900- and 200-bp intron sequences.
However, distinct [$RFLPs#Gene*] in the 900-bp intron were consistently associated with each species and could be used to qualitatively and quantitatively distinguish each species.
Furthermore, each of the species showed distinct host specificity, with isolates of [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] (from [$cucurbits#Plant*]), [$C.lindemuthianum#Virus*], and [$C.trifolii#Virus*] being [$pathogen#Virus*]ic only on [$cucurbits#Plant*], [@green bean#Plant*], and [$alfalfa#Plant*], respectively.
Consequently, distinct and fixed nucleotide, or genotypic (intron sequences and [$RFLPs#Gene*]) and phenotypic (host specificity) characteristics can be used to distinguish [$C.orbiculare#Virus*], [$C.lindemuthianum#Virus*], and [$C.trifolii#Virus*] from one another; therefore, they should be recognized as distinct species.
This species delineation is consistent with the most current species concepts in fungi.
More isolates and further characterization is needed to determine whether [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] from cocklebur and [$C.malvarum #Virus*]represent distinct species.
[$RFLPs#Gene*] of the 900-bp intron may represent a relatively inexpensive, reliable, and useful diagnostic tool for general species differentiation in the genus [$Colletotrichum#Virus*].
