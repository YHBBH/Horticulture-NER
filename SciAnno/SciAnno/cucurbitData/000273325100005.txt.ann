BACKGROUND: Management of [@strawberry powdery mildew#Virus*], [@Podopshaera aphanis (Walir.)#Virus*], requires numerous fungicide treatments.
Limiting epidemics is heavily dependent on sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) such as myclobutanil or penconazole.
Recently, a noticeable reduction in the efficacy of these triazole fungicides was reported by [$strawberry#Plant*] growers in France.
The goal of this study was to investigate the state of DMI sensitivity of French [@P.ophanis#Virus*] and provide tools for improved pest management.
   RESULTS: Using leaf disc sporulation assays, sensitivity to myclobutanil and penconazole of 23 isolates of [@P.aphanis#Virus*] was monitored.
Myclobutanil EC50 ranged from less than 0.1 to 14.67 mg L-1 and for penconazole from 0.04 to 4.2 mg L-1.
A cross-analysis and a Venn diagram showed that there was reduced sensitivity and a positive correlation between the less sensitive myclobutanil and penconazole isolates; 73.9% of isolates were less sensitive to a DMI and 47.8% exhibited less sensitivity to both fungicides.
   CONCLUSION: The results show that sensitivity to myclobutanil and, to a lesser extent, penconazole has become less efficient in [$strawberry powdery mildew#Virus*] in France.
Therefore, urgent action is required in order to document its appearance and optimise methods of control.
