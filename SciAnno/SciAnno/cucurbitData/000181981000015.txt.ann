[@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] ([$pumpkin#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [@gourd#Plant*]) is an economically important species that is susceptible to the [$cucurbit powdery mildew fungus#Virus*], [$Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*] (syn.
[$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]).
'True French', an open-pollinated cultivar of the [$Zucchini#Plant*] Group of [@C.pepo#Plant*], was crossed with an unnamed [@powdery-mildew#Disease*] resistant straightneck-type accession, the resistance of which was apparently derived from an interspecific cross with a resistant wild species of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*], and resistant plants were selected in the F-2 generation.
This was followed by six cycles of backcross-pedigree selection for resistance, and resulted in the development of an accession true-breeding for resistance to [$powdery mildew#Disease*] and nearly isogenic to 'True French'.
The resistant and susceptible near-isogenics were crossed and seeds of the filial and backcross generations were produced.
Plants of the parental acces[$sions#Plant*] and their progenies were grown together in a controlled-environment ch[$amber#Plant*], exposed to the [$pathogen#Virus*]ic [$fungus#Virus*], and scored as resistant, partially resistant, or susceptible 27-33 days after [$sowing#Plant*].
The results indicated that resistance is conferred by a single incompletely dominant gene, designated Pm-0.
