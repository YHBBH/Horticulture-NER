The European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR) is a regional network funded by the European countries and coordinated by Bioversity International.
The Vegetables Network with representatives of 42 countries, is one of the crop specific ECPGR networks (http://www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/networks/vegetables.html).
It consists of six Working Groups (WGs), i.e., on [@Allium#Plant*], [$Brassica#Plant*], [$Cucurbits#Plant*], [@Leafy Vegetables#Plant*], [$Solanaceae #Plant*]and [@Umbellifer Crops#Plant*].
Sharing responsibilities for the ex situ conservation of European [$vegetable crops#Plant*] genetic resources is the highest priority of the [$Vegetables#Plant*] Network.
It is foreseen that the rationalization of the collections will lead to higher cost-efficiency, and improvement of plant genetic resources documentation and quality.
These efforts will be continued within the framework of the AEGIS initiative (A European Genebank Integrated System) (http://www.aegis.cgiar.org/).
Challenges for the [$Vegetables#Plant*] Network include the identification of the so-called Most Appropriate Accessions (MAA) for each [$crop#Plant*] for their inclusion in the decentrally managed European Collection, and the development of agreed [$crop#Plant*] specific technical standards for conservation.
   Achievements of the Network in recent years include the development of European Central Crop Databases (ECCDBs), quality standards for collection management of seed-propagated [$crops#Plant*] and cryopreserved material, safety duplication improvement and definition of minimum characterization descriptors.
Several EU-funded projects have initiated and accelerated the activities of the WGs.
Apart from further improvements within the framework of AEGIS, the Network is planning a number of other initiatives, such as improving collaboration at the global level ([$Allium#Plant*]), developing molecular characterization protocols ([$lettuce#Plant*]), filling the gaps in the conservation of wild relatives ([$Brassica#Plant*] and [$Umbellifer Crops#Plant*]), and improving the Network's communication with the scientific community and the public at large.
