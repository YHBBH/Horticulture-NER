During surveys conducted in 2012-2013, viruslike symptoms of chlorotic spots with, in some cases, a necrotic centre in older leaves were observed in field- and greenhouse-grown [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]), [$melon#Plant*] ([$C.melo L.#Plant*]) and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita sp.#Plant*]) in the major [$cucurbit #Plant*]cultivation regions in Iran.
Leaf samples were collected and tested for the presence of [$Cucumber leaf spot virus#Virus*] ([$CLSV#Virus*], [@genus Aureusvirus#Virus*], [@family Tombusviridae#Virus*]) by a [@virus specific double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]).
[$CLSV#Virus*] was detected in four of eight surveyed provinces in [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*].
When plant sap of [$ELISA#Method*] positive samples was used to mechanically inoculate healthy [$squash plant#Plant*]s, chlorotic spots with, in some cases, necrotic centres were observed on the inoculated leaves 20-25days postinoculation.
The presence of [$CLSV#Virus*] was confirmed by [@reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions using specific primers#Method*] amplifying the entire [$coat protein gene#Gene*] of [$CLSV#Virus*].
Sequence comparison with sequences available at GenBank showed 93% nucleotide sequence identity to [$CLSV#Virus*] isolates from Israel (DQ227315) and Canada (EU127904), the only [$CLSV#Virus*] [$coat protein#Gene*] sequences available.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of [$CLSV#Virus*] in Iran.
