Different proportions of [$tomato#Plant*] waste compost (TWC) were combined with peat moss and vermiculite as growth substrates used to evaluate the quality of [$seedlings#Plant*] of economic [$vegetables#Plant*], including [$tomato#Plant*], hot [$pepper#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and[$ summer squash#Plant*].
The seeding substrates used were: (T0), vermiculite: peat moss: TWC (4: 1: 0, by weight), 0% TWC; (T1), vermiculite: peat: TWC (4: 0.75: 0.25), 5% TWC; (T2), vermiculite: peat: TWC (4: 0.5: 0.5), 10% TWC; (T3), vermiculite: peat: TWC (4: 0.25: 0.75), 15% TWC; and (T4), vermiculite: peat: TWC (4: 0: 1), 20% TWC.
The best seedling response was recorded in substrate mixtures supplemented with 5% and 10% TWC, which hastened seed germination and improved seedling morphology.
Since [$vegetable seedlings#Plant*] produced with TWC-amended substrate were of higher quality, compared to those produced exclusively on peat substrate, we suggest that TWC may be used to replace partially peat-based substrate used for [$vegetable#Plant*] transplants production in nurseries.
