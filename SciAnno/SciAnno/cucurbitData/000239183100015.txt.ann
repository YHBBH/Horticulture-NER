Increases in phospholipase D [PLD (EC 3.1.4.4)] and lipoxygenase [LOX (EC 1.13.11.12)] activities are thought to play a critical role in senescence of mesocarp tissues in netted and normetted [@muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) fruits.
We have cloned and characterized two full-length cDNAs, [@CmPLD alpha 1#Gene*] and [@CmLOX1#Gene*], encoding PLD alpha and LOX proteins in [@honeydew melon#Plant*] ([@C.melo Inodorus Group cv.Honey Brew#Plant*]).
Relative levels of expression of the corresponding genes were determined by semi-quantitative [$RT-PCR#Method*] in developing and mature fruit mesocarp tissues [20-60 d after pollination (DAP)], as well as in roots, leaves, and stems from 4-week-old and flowers from 6- to 7-week-old plants.
The coding regions of [@CITIPLD alpha 1#Gene*] and [$CmLOX1#Gene*] cDNAs are, respectively, 2427 and 2634 nucleotides long, encoding proteins 808 and 877 amino acids in length.
[$CmPLD alpha 1#Gene*] is very similar to [@PLD alpha genes#Gene*] from [@castor bean#Plant*] ([@Ricinis communis L.#Plant*]), [@cowpea#Plant*] ([@Vigna unguiculata L.#Plant*]), [$strawberry#Plant*] ([@Fragaria xananassa Duch.#Plant*]) and [$tomato#Plant*] ([@Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.#Plant*]) (77% nucleotide identity), and is the first [@PLD gene#Gene*] cloned from a [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
[$CmLOX1#Gene*] has 94% nucleotide identity to a [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) [@LOX gene#Gene*] expressed in roots and 80% identity to [$cucumber#Plant*] cotyledon lipid body [@LOX#Gene*].
In general, transcript of [$CmPLD alpha 1#Gene*] was much more abundant than that of [$CmLOX1#Gene*], but relative levels of transcript in the various organs and tissues were similar for the two genes.
Expression was highest in roots, flowers, and fruit mesocarp tissues.
[$CmPLD alpha 1#Gene*] expression in fruit was essentially constitutive throughout development, although maximum levels occurred at 50 and 55 DAP, respectively, in middle and hypodermal mesocarp.
[$CmLOX1#Gene*] expression was generally higher in middle than in hypodermal mesocarp with maximum transcript levels occurring at 55 and 50 DAP, respectively.
Overall, the patterns of expression of [$CmPLD alpha 1#Gene*] and [$CmLOX1#Gene*] are consistent with a model in which their encoded enzymes act in tandem to promote or accelerate senescence in fruit mesocarp tissues.
