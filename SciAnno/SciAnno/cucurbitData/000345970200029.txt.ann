[@Sponge gourd#Plant*] is a versatile [$vegetable#Plant*] that can be used as a household cleaning product, industrial material and medicine, and possesses anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity.
In the current study, a large dataset composed of 77,858 unigenes derived from the [$sponge gourd#Plant*] transcriptome was assembled.
Of all unigenes, 52,113 (66.93 %) had significant similarity to known proteins from NCBI non-redundant, Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Group and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases.
Based on these generated sequences, we identified 12,932 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and successfully designed 8,523 high-quality SSR primer pairs.
Six hundred and forty-one primer pairs were randomly selected to be verified among S1174 [[@Luffa acutangula (L.) Roxb.#Plant*]], 93075 [[@L.cylindrica (L.) Roem.#Plant*]] and their hybrid F1.
The result showed that 494 (77.07 %) exhibited successful amplification, of which 201 (40.69 %) revealed polymorphism between S1174 and 93075.
Fifty polymorphic expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSRs were used to genotype 60 [$sponge gourd#Plant*] accessions.
[$Cluster analysis#Method*] revealed two major clusters, one comprising 42 accessions of L.
acutangula and the other 18 accessions belonging to [@L.cylindrica#Plant*].
Transferability of the 77 polymorphic [$EST-SSR markers #Method*]was investigated in six other [$cucurbits#Plant*]: [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$wax gourd#Plant*], [$bitter gourd#Plant*], [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and chieh-qua, and the percentage of cross-genus amplification was 85.90, 83.33, 83.33, 79.49, 75.64 and 74.36 %, respectively.
This indicated that EST-SSRs in [$sponge gourd#Plant*] could well be applied to other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
These transcriptome shotgun assembly sequences and EST-SSR data are of great value for the discovery of novel genes and for marker-assisted selection in [$sponge gourd#Plant*].
