China, as one of the ancient centers for diversity of domesticated plants, has a rich germplasm resource in [$vegetable#Plant*] and [$fruit crops#Plant*].
The [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] is one of the three most important families in that country as sources of [$vegetables#Plant*].
In a continuing effort to inform the West on Chinese uses of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], we update a 1989 description of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in China with the inclusion of information from untranslated Chinese literature and further field observations.
Included are 63 species valued as fruits, [$vegetables#Plant*], and/or medicinal [$herbs#Plant*].
Each of these species is discussed in the context of its usages in China.
We summarize the economic role of cultivated [$cucurbits#Plant*] in present day China.
Finally, the infraspecific variation within the economically important domesticated [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*], [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*], [$Luffa spp.#Plant*], and [$Momordica charantia#Plant*]) is discussed.
