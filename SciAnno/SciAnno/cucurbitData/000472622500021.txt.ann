[@Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MWMV#Virus*]) represents an emerging threat to [$cucurbit #Plant*]production in the Mediterranean Basin.
We sequenced the near complete genome of [$MWMV#Virus*]-SQ10_1.1, a cloned Spanish isolate.
[$MWMV#Virus*]-SQ10_1.1 has the typical [$potyvirus#Virus*] genomic structure, and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] showed that it shared a common ancestor with other Mediterranean [$MWMV#Virus*] isolates.
We used [$MWMV#Virus*] SQ10_1.1 to inoculate plants in a collection of commercial [$squash #Plant*]cultivars, including some described as [$potyvirus#Virus*] resistant.
All inoculated plants from all cultivars showed severe infection symptoms.
Twenty-four [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
accessions were then tested for their susceptibility to [$MWMV#Virus*]-SQ10_1.1.
Plants of the C.ecuadorensis PI 432441 accession showed no symptoms and their [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] readings were similar to uninfected controls.
Progeny analysis of F1 and F2 populations suggested that two recessive genes control PI 432441 resistance to [$MWMV#Virus*].
We hypothesized that this resistance could be associated with alleles of genes encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), particularly after determination of its recessive nature.
A multiple sequence alignment including the two eIF4E ortholog sequences from PI 432441 (CeeIF4E1 and CeeIF4E2) identified three amino acid substitutions in CeeIF4E1 and two amino acid substitutions in CeeIF4E2 potentially involved in [$potyvirus#Virus*] resistance.
[$Polymerase chain reaction#Method*] markers for CeeIF4E1 and CeeIF4E2 were developed and used to genotype 156 F2 individuals already phenotyped; this analysis did not support an association of either CeeIF4E2 or CeeIF4E1 with [$MWMV#Virus*] resistance.
