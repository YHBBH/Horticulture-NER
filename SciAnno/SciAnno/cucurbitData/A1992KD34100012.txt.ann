Mild-strain cross protection was used in field trials at Wellesbourne and in Jersey in attempts to protect courgette plants against severe strains of [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*].
Test plants were sap inoculated with the mild strain and then challenged by an aphid-transmitted severe strain after different periods.
Approximately 14 days of incubation were required following mild-strain inoculation to provide protection against subsequent infection by severe strains.
No protection occurred if severe strains were introduced 2 days (48 h) after mild-strain inoculation and protection was intermediate if the severe-strain challenge occurred after 7-8 days.
Some breakdown in protection occurred in the later stages of the trial at Wellesboume, but not in Jersey.
This loss of protection may be associated with high inoculum pressures.
