An insect specific alpha-amylase inhibitor (alpha-Al) from seeds of CO3 variety of little [@millet#Plant*] ([@Panicum sumatrens Roth#Plant*]) was isolated and purified to homogeneity following [@ammonium sulfate precipitation#Method*], [@successive chromatographic separations on Sephadex G75#Method*] and [@CM- cellulose columns#Method*] and finally through [@RP-HPLC#Method*].
[@Western blotting#Method*] using polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified alpha-Al identified a unique band.
The purified protein was found to be a non-glycosylated polypeptide with a molecular weight of 36kD.
The isolated inhibitor severely inhibited the larval midgut alpha-amylases of [@tomato fruit borer#Virus*] ([@Helicoverpa armigera#Virus*]), [@brinjal shoot and fruit borer#Virus*] ([@Leucinodes orbonalis#Virus*]) and [@cucurbit fruit fly#Virus*] ([@Dacus cucurbitae#Virus*]).
