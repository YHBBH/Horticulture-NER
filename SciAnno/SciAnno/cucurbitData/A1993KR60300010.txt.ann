 Purified cucurbitacin B and E act as feeding stimulants for the red [$pumpkin#Plant*] beetle, but on testing three pairs of isogenic bitter (Bi) and non-bitter (bi) lines of [$cucumber#Plant*], no relationship was found to exist between the bitter gene and the degree of damage caused by this [$beet#Pant*]le.
In[$ summer squash#Plant*], both resistant and susceptible lines contain [$cucurbit#Virus*]acin at the susceptible plant growth stage (cotyledon) but there was no correlation between the quantity of total phenols, free amino acids or reducing sugars in this material and resistance.
[$Bitter gourd#Plant*], which has [$cucurbit#Virus*]acin in the cotyledons, was not preferred by the beetle.
