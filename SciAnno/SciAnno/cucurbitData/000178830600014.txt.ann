Prevention of the introduction of [@bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] of [$watermelon#Plant*], caused by [@Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], into the transplant house or field is the most effective control strategy.
[$Watermelon#Plant*] seedlots currently are screened for [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], but other [$cucurbits#Plant*], often grown in the same transplant house or field, generally are not as carefully monitored.
In 1997 and 1999 field tests, cultivars of [$watermelon#Plant*], [$muskmelon#Plant*], [$honeydew melons#Plant*], [@acorn squash#Plant*], [@butternut squash#Plant*], [@yellow squash#Plant*], [$zucchini squash#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [$pumpkin#Plant*] were evaluated for foliar and fruit susceptibility to [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] and for seed transmission of [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*].
The bacterium was introduced into the field on infected [$watermelon#Plant*] transplants or by misting a bacterial suspension onto fruit of the [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Foliar and fruit symptoms were more extensive in the [$watermelon#Plant*], [$muskmelon#Plant*], and [$honeydew melons#Plant*] than in the other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
In [@greenhouse grow-out assays#Method*], seed transmission of [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] was detected in every [$cucurbit#Plant*] in at least one of the two seasons, even though there were no fruit symptoms in some of them.
Thus, any [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] plant should be considered a potential source for the introduction of [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] into the transplant house or field.
