The conducting elements of phloem in angiosperms are a complex of two cell types, sieve elements and companion cells, that form a single developmental and functional unit.
During ontogeny of the sieve element/companion cell complex, specific proteins accumulate forming unique structures within sieve elements.
Synthesis of these proteins coincides with vascular development and was studied in [@Cucurbita seedling#Plant*] by following accumulation of the phloem lectin ([$PP2#Gene*]) and [@its mRNA by RNA blot analysis#Method*], [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*], [@immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization#Method*].
Genes encoding [$PP2#Gene*] were developmentally regulated during vascular differentiation in hypocotyls of [@Cucurbita maxima Duch#Plant*].
Accumulation of [$PP2#Gene*] mRNA and protein paralleled one another during hypocotyl elongation, after which mRNA levels decreased, while the protein apeared to be stable.
Both [$PP2#Gene*] and its mRNA were initially detected during metaphloem differentiation.
However, [$PP2#Gene*] mRNA was detected in companion cells of both bundle and extrafascicular phloem, but never in differentiating sieve elements.
At later stages of development, [$PP2#Gene*] mRNA was most often observed in extrafascicular phloem.
In developing stems of [@Cucurbita moschata L.#Plant*], [$PP2#Gene*] was immunolocalized in companion cells but not to filamentous phloem protein (P-protein) bodies that characterize immature sieve elements of bundle phloem.
In contrast, [$PP2#Gene*] was immunolocalized to persistent P-protein bodies in sieve elements of the extrafascicular phloem.
Immunolocalization of [$PP2#Gene*] in mature wound sieve elements was similar to that in bundle phloem.
It appears that [$PP2#Gene*] is synthesized in companion cells, then transported into differentiated sieve elements where it is a component of P-protein filaments in bundle phloem and persistent P-protein bodies in extrafascicular phloem.
This differential accumulation in bundle and extrafascicular elements may result from different functional roles of the two types of phloem.
