Rootstock lines of wild [@watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus subsp.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*]) with resistance to [$root-knot nematodes#Virus*] ([@RKN#Virus*]) were developed at the U.S.
Vegetable Laboratory.
Rootstock lines RKVL 301, RKVL 316, and RKVL 318 (RKVL = Root Knot Vegetable Laboratory) were compared to wild commercial [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks and tinda ([$Praecitrullus fistulosus#Plant*]) for grafted seedless triploid [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@C.lanatus subsp.vulgaris var.vulgaris#Plant*]) 'Tri-X 313' in fields infested with southern [$RKN#Virus*] ([$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*]) in Charleston, SC.
RKVL wild [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstocks had lower (P<0.05) root galling (range: 9% to 16%) than non-grafted 'Tri-X 313' (41%), 'Emphasis' (86%), 'Strong Tosa' (99%), and wild tinda (96%) rootstocks.
The RKVL 318 rootstock produced higher fruit yield (29.5 kg/plot of 6 plants) (P<0.05) than all other rootstocks (mean = 11.0 kg/plot), except for self-grafted 'Tri-X 313' [$watermelon#Plant*] (21.5 kg/plot).
The three RKVL wild [$watermelon#Plant*] lines should be useful rootstocks for grafted [$watermelon#Plant*], and useful germplasm sources for developing [$RKN#Virus*]-resistant [$watermelon#Plant*] breeding lines and cultivars.
In [$greenhouse tests#Method*], we evaluated reaction of 23 commercial [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks and germplasm accessions including African horned [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis metuliferus#Plant*]), [$pumpkin#Plant*]y([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]), hybrid [$squash #Plant*]([$C.maxima#Plant*] x [$C.moschata#Plant*]), and [$melon#Plant*].
[$Melon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]exhibited the most severe root galling (range: 4.2-5.0 using a 1 to 5 rating scale where 1=no galls and 5=more than 80% of root system galled) in the greenhouse test.
African horned [$cucumber#Plant*] was moderately resistant to susceptible (galling range 2.6-3.2).
Several accessions of different [$cucurbit species #Plant*]were evaluated as rootstocks for grafted 'Athena' [$melon#Plant*] in a field infested with [$RKN#Virus*] ([$M.incognita#Virus*]) in Charleston, SC.
All[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] spp.and [$C.melo#Plant*] entries were highly susceptible to [$M.incognita#Virus*] in the field tests as evidenced by high numbers of [$M.incognita#Virus*] eggs in roots (up to 3600 eggs/gram fresh root).
African horned [$cucumber#Plant*] rootstocks supported the lowest [$RKN#Virus*] reproduction.
All rootstocks were compatible with the scion 'Athena' [$melon#Plant*].
Additional studies are underway for developing African horned [$cucumber#Plant*] rootstocks that could be useful for managing [$RKN#Virus*] in grafted [$melon#Plant*].
