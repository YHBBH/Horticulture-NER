[@Bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*], caused by the gram-negative bacterium Acid-ovorax citrulli, is a serious economic threat to [$cucurbit crop#Plant*] production worldwide.
[$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains can be divided into two genetically distinct groups, with group I strains infecting a range of [$cucurbit species #Plant*]and group II strains being predominantly associated with [$watermelon#Plant*].
Group I and II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains differ in their arsenal of type III secreted (T3S) effector proteins and we hypothesize that these effectors are critical for [$cucurbit #Plant*]host preference.
However, the [$pathogenicity#Plant*] or virulence assays used for [$A.citrulli#Virus*], including infiltration of seedling cotyledons and mature fruit rind tissues with cell suspensions and spray inoculation of [$seedlings#Plant*], lack the sensitivity to consistently distinguish strains of the two groups.
Here, we describe an immature, detached [$melon#Plant*] fruit assay based on 'Joaquin Gold' [$melon#Plant*] (Syngenta, Rogers Brand) that clearly indicates differences in host specificity between group I and II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains.
Using this assay, four group I strains (M6, AAC213-52, AAC213-55, and XJL12) induced typical water-soaked lesions in [$melon#Plant*] fruit rind tissue 7 to 10 days after pinprick inoculation.
In contrast, four group II strains (AAC00-1, AAC213-44, AAC213-47, and AAC213-48) did not induce water-soaked lesions on detached [$melon#Plant*] fruit rinds during the same period.
These data suggest that group I [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains have a specific capacity to infect immature Joaquin Gold [$melon#Plant*] fruit, whereas group II strains do not.
Interestingly, this differential [$pathogenicity#Plant*] phenotype was not observed on foliar seedling tissues of the same [$melon#Plant*] cultivar, suggesting that host preference of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains is specific to immature fruit tissues.
Using the immature [$melon#Plant*] fruit inoculation assay, a T3S system mutant of the group I [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strain, M6 (M6DhrcV), failed to induce water soaking.
This indicates that T3S effectors are involved in [$A.citrulli #Virus*][$cucurbit #Plant*]host preference, and that this assay is suitable for future studies of unique T3S effectors that distinguish group I and II strains.
