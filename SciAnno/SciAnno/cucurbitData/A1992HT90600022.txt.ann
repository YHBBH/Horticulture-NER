 The sterol composition of [$conidia#Virus*] of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*]s of [$apple#Plant*] ([$Podosphaera leucotricha#Virus*]), [$barley#Plant*] ([@Erysiphe graminis f.sp.hordei#Plant*]), and [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]) was very similar, and simple compared with that of other [@plant pathogenic fungi#Virus*].
Ergosta-5,24(24(1))-dien-3-beta-ol was the principal sterol in all three species, accompanied by much smaller amounts of 5-alpha-ergosta-7,24(24(1))-dien-3-beta-ol in [$apple#Plant*] and [$barley#Plant*] [$mildews#Disease*], and cholesterol in the [$cucurbit #Plant*][$mildew#Virus*].
All the ergostane derivatives found share the structural feature of a 24(24(1))-double bond, suggesting that in[$ powdery mildew#Virus*]s sterol side-chain biosynthesis does not proceed beyond the initial introduction of C-24(1).
