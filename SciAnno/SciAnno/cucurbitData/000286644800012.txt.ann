[@Squash leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([$SLCV#Virus*]) and [@Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]) are [@cucurbit-infecting bipartite begomoviruses#Virus*].
Both viruses are found in the eastern Mediterranean basin but the effects of dual infection of both viruses on [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) have not been described.
'Arava' [$melon plants#Plant*] were inoculated in the greenhouse, using [$whiteflies#Virus*], with either [$SLCV#Virus*].
[$WmCSV#Virus*], or both.
Control plants were exposed to nonviruliferous [$whiteflies#Virus*] or not exposed at all.
Following inoculation, plants were transplanted to a 50-mesh insect-proof nethouse and grown until fruit maturity.
The experiment was performed in two [$melon#Plant*]-growing seasons: spring, transplant in May and harvest in July; and summer, transplant in August and harvest in October.
Following inoculation, [$SLCV#Virus*]-infected [$melon plants#Plant*] showed mild symptoms that disap[$pea#Plant*]red with time, and there was no effect on plant height.
[$WmCSV#Virus*]-nfected plants developed disease symptoms that became more obvious with time, and plants were somewhat shorter than control plants in the spring but not in the summer.
[$SLCV#Virus*] had no effect on yield, regardless of season.
[$WmCSV#Virus*] had no statistically significant effect on yield in the spring but, in the summer, reduced yield by 22%, on average.
Dual-inoculated plants showed a synergistic interaction between the two viruses.
They developed disease symptoms that were more pronounced than [$WmCSV#Virus*] alone, with plants being shorter than control plants by 20 to 25% regardless of season.
Moreover, the yield of dual-inoculated plants was reduced on average by 21% in the spring and 54% in the summer, and fruit appearance was adversely affected.
Dual inoculation did not affect [$WmCSV#Virus*] DNA level but [$SLCV#Virus*] DNA level was increased several-fold by the presence of [$WmCSV#Virus*].
