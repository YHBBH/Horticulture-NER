[@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], the causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], is one of the most economically important plant [$pathogens#Virus*].
[$Muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) is seriously affected by [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
Within [$C.melo#Plant*], several genotypes resistant to [$P.cubensis #Virus*]have been described; however, we lack detailed experimental studies focused on deciphering variation in this host-[$pathogen#Virus*] interaction.
This study aims to describe race-specific variation in interactions between [$C.melo#Plant*] germplasm and isolates of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
Under controlled inoculation, 52 accessions of [$C.melo#Plant*] were studied for resistance/susceptibility to 8 isolates of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
The plant material was obtained from the USDA Plant Introduction Station, Ames, Iowa, USA.
Pathogen isolates originated from the Czech Republic (7 isolates) and France (1 isolate) and represented 8 distinct pathotypes as determined following Lebeda and Widrlechner (2003).
Collectively, 8 different race-specific reaction patterns were recorded.
Most [$C.melo#Plant*] accessions (in total, 39) were highly susceptible to all isolates.
None of screened [$C.melo#Plant*] accessions expressed complete resistance to all isolates.
Only accession PI 315410 (VIR 5682) was found to be resistant to 7 of the 8 [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates.
The study confirmed the race-specificity of interactions between [$C.melo#Plant*] and [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and established a sound framework for the development of a system to determine and classify [$P.cubensis #Virus*]races, which, in turn, should foster further broad screening of [$C.melo#Plant*] germplasm with a likelihood of detecting more effective sources of resistance to important pathotypes and races of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
