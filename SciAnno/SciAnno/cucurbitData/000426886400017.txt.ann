[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) reduces [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) fruit quality and yield in many parts of the world.
Host plant resistance of [$melon#Plant*] to [$CYSDV#Virus*] is a high priority for sustainable [$melon#Plant*] production in affected production areas.
High-level resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] exhibited by TGR 1551 (PI 482420) appeared, initially, to be controlled by a dominant gene, based on [$greenhouse tests#Method*] in Malaga, Spain that were terminated 28 to 42 days post-inoculation (DPI).
We report here results of tests that were evaluated over periods ranging from 49 DPI (Malaga) to 91 DPI (Texas) following exposure to [$CYSDV#Virus*] that show resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] in TGR 1551 to be a recessive trait.
Mean [$CYSDV#Virus*] symptom severity rating of F-1 TGR 1551 x 'Dulce' did not significantly differ from the mean rating for TGR 1551, but the F-2 distribution suggested a recessive gene for resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] in controlled inoculation, [$greenhouse tests#Method*] in Texas.
The F-1 TGR 1551 x 'Bola de Oro' was susceptible in a greenhouse in Malaga, where it exhibited [$CYSDV#Virus*] symptoms and was positive for [$CYSDV#Virus*] infection prior to symptom expression.
TGR 1551 clearly expressed recessive genetic resistance in open field tests in Imperial Valley, California where the mean symptom severity ratings of 'Top Mark' and the F-1 TGR 1551 x 'Top Mark' were not significantly different, and the F-2 and respective testcrosses confirmed recessive resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*].
