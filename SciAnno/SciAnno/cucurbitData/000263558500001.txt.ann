Turkey is very rich in cucurbit genetic resources due to its diverse geographical and ecological situation.
Turkey is one of the important diversity centers for cultivated [@cucurbits#Plant*] because of the adaptation to diverse ecological conditions as result of natural selection and also the farmers selection in accordance with their preference.
   National collection of [@Citcurbitaceae species#Plant*] at National Gene Bank of Turkey (AARI) consists of 2223 accessions.
Collecting activities have been systematically conducted since early 1960s.
25.7% of this amount is [$melon#Plant*], 20.5% is[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] spp., 16.1% is [$watermelon#Plant*], 13.4% is [$cucumber#Plant*], 7.7% is [$bottle gourd#Plant*], 7.2% is [$squash#Plant*], 4.2% is [$winter squash#Plant*], 3.3% is [$snake melon#Plant*], 1.3% is [$pumpkin#Plant*], 0.3% Is other [$cucumbers#Plant*], 0.2% [$squirting cucumber#Plant*] and 0.1% of bryony.
   [$Melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] genetic resources collections and their morphological and molecular characterization trials were done In Cukurova University and approximately 400 [$melon#Plant*] and 355 [$watermelon#Plant*] accessions were collected.
[$Squash#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*] studies were done in Ondokuz Mayis and Ankara University and 128 [$winter squash#Plant*], 40 [$pumpkin#Plant*] populations and 20 snack seed [$squash #Plant*]were collected and characterized.
Selected [$pumpkins#Plant*] also were characterized molecularly.
[$Bottle gourd#Plant*] characterization trials were done in Mustafa Kemal University and 188 accessions were characterized.
Snake [$melon#Plant*] research activities were conducted at Ankara and Cukurova Universities and 62 accessions were characterized.
The evaluation and breeding programs of these genetic resources are ongoing.
