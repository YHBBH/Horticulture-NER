A virus isolate (Su-95-67) was obtained from a snake [@melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo var.flexuosus#Plant*]) plant presenting severe chlorotic spots, mosaic, stunting, and leaf deformations collected in Eastern Sudan in 1995.
Su-95-67 was easily mechanically transmissible and had a host range limited to a few [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
Isometric virus particles approximately 30 nm in diameter were observed in leaf dip preparations.
A cytopathological study did not reveal alterations specific for a virus genus or family.
A polyclonal antiserum was obtained and used in double-antibody sandwich [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]).
Su-95-67 was transmitted by seed at a low rate, by the [@red melon beetle#Virus*] ([@Aulacophora foveicollis#Virus*]), but not by the [@melon aphid#Virus*] ([@Aphis gossypii#Virus*]).
Because Su-95-67 shared several properties with sobemoviruses, generic [$Sobemovirus#Virus*] [@reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction primers#Method*] were developed.
They allowed amplification of a 384-bp fragment from extracts of plants infected by two sobemoviruses or by Su-95-67 but not from healthy plants extracts.
Sequence comparison confirmed that Su-95-67 belongs to a new tentative [$Sobemovirus#Virus*] species for which we propose the name [@Snake melon asteroid mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@SMAMV#Virus*]).
[$DAS-ELISA#Method*] tests conducted on extracts of virus-infected [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] collected from 1992 to 2003 revealed the presence of [$SMAMV#Virus*] in 10.2% of 600 samples originating from different regions of Sudan.
