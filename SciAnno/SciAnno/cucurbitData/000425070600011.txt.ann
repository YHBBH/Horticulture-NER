[@Anthracnose#Disease*], caused by [@Colletotrichum orbiculare race 2#Virus*], has re-emerged as a problematic disease on [$watermelon#Plant*] in the southern United States where the majority of U.
S.
[$watermelons#Plant*] are produced.
Although several new fungicide active ingredients have been registered on [$cucurbits#Plant*], their effects on [$watermelon#Plant*] yields produced during [$anthracnose#Virus*] epidemics have not been assessed.
[$Field experiments#Method*] were done in 2014 and 2017 on seeded [$watermelon#Plant*] treated with 13 fungicides in FRAC Groups 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 27, M03, and M05.
Trifloxystrobin, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, thiophanate-methyl, chlorothalonil, and mancozeb consistently reduced the severity of foliar [$anthracnose#Virus*] compared to water and to the other seven fungicides tested.
In general, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and trifloxystrobin increased the numbers and weights of total and marketable-sized fruit and reduced the percentage of fruit with symptoms of [$anthracnose#Virus*] compared to the water control and to FRAC Group 7 fungicides.
These three fungicides also increased the soluble solids content of fruit in 2014.
Multi-site fungicides and strobilurin fungicides were more effective against [$anthracnose#Virus*] than fungicides in FRAC Groups 3, 7, 9, and 27.
