This paper treats the identification of modeled images of [@cucurbits#Plant*]-[$gourds#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*]-in the ceramics of the Late Formative Era (or Chorrera culture) of coastal Ecuador (ca.
900 B.C.
to 100 A.D.).
These images provide good evidence for the sophisticated cultivation of [$cucurbits#Plant*] by the native peoples of the coast of South America from very early time periods in Ecuador.
Their importance in the iconography of Late Formative cultures certainly demonstrates that the domestication of fruits with both hard and soft rinds must have been well established by the time ceramic production had begun.
Depictions of combinations of animals with [$cucurbit#Plant*]-shaped bodies in the mortuary ceramics of the Late Formative period also demonstrate that [$cucurbits#Plant*] were an essential part of life (and death) on the coast of Ecuador.
