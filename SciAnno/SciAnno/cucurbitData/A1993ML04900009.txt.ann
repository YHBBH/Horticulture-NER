Twenty-four isolates of [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], three isolates of [$C.magna#Virus*], and two putative isolates of [@Glomerella cingulata var.orbiculare#Virus*], representing diverse geographical and [$cucurbit #Plant*]host origins, vegetative compatibility groups, and races were examined for mitochondrial and [@nuclear DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)#Method*], Six isolates of [$C orbiculare#Virus*] from cocklebur, a non[$cucurbit #Plant*]host, also were examined.
Four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes, designated A, Al, B, and C, were observed among the isolates examined.
Twenty-two isolates, representing three vegetative compatibility groups and two races [$pathogen#Virus*]ic to [$cucurbits#Plant*], had an identical mtDNA RFLP haplotype (haplotype A) with each of seven restriction enzymes.
Six cocklebur isolates (nonpathogenic on [$cucurbits#Plant*]) had an mtDNA RFLP haplotype identical to the [$pathogen#Virus*]ic isolates with six of the seven restriction enzymes examined; however, restriction enzyme PvuII detected a single additional restriction site in the mtDNA of the cocklebur isolates (haplotype Al).
Three non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic isolates of [$C magna#Plant*] had a third mtDNA RFLP haplotype (haplotype B).
Two nonpathogenic isolates of [$C orbiculare#Virus*] from [$honeydew melon#Plant*] and two non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic isolates of [$Glomerella cingulata#Virus*] var.
orbiculare from cucuzzi [$gourd#Virus*] had a fourth mtDNA RFLP haplotype (haplotype C).
DNA fingerprinting, which was conducted with the synthetic oligonucleotide probe (CAT)5 or a human minisatellite DNA probe, identified these same four haplotypes.
Five RAPD primers also resolved the four RFLP groups.
One RAPD primer resolved two groups among isolates within mtDNA RFLP haplotype A that correlated with host origin, vegetative compatibility group, and race.
Thus, one RAPD primer differentiated the two races of [$C orbiculare#Virus*].
Overall, there was a strict correspondence between mtDNA RFLP haplotype, DNA fingerprint group, and RAPD group among the isolates examined.
