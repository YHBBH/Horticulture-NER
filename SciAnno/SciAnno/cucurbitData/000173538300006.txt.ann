Two nonpathogenic mutant strains 4/4 and 15/15 of [@Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] (race 1,2) were isolated by a [@continuous dipinoculation technique#Method*] following [@UV mutagenesis#Method*] of the virulent wildtype isolate FOM1.2.
No disease symptoms or detrimental effects were observed following inoculation of [$muskmelon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] by strain 4/4.
In contrast, strain 15115 caused mortality of susceptible cultivars although to a lesser extent than the wild-type isolate.
Strain 4/4 colonized a variety of [$muskmelon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars.
In [@muskmelon cv.Ein Dor#Plant*], [$seedlings#Plant*] were dipped in a [$conidia#Virus*]l suspension of strain 4/4 and planted in medium amended with the mutant to achieve, 100% colonization of roots and between 30 to 70% of the lower stem tissues 7 days after planting.
Similar percent colonization of [$watermelon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] by strain 4/4 was recorded.
In [@cross-protection experiments#Method*] with [$muskmelon#Plant*] cultivars, significant reduction in seedling mortality was observed between 4/4-colonized FOM1.2.
challenged plants compared with that of wild-type challenged plants alone.
Similarly, strain 4/4 was able to significantly reduce mortality of [$watermelon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] caused by [@F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum race 2#Virus*].
This novel approach of generating non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic mutants for biological control in [$Fusarium spp#Virus*].and other [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] from virulent wild-type isolates may be beneficial for control, because the mutant strains, lacking only in [$pathogenicity#Method*], may compete more efficiently than other biocontrol organisms against the [$pathogen#Virus*] of origin.
