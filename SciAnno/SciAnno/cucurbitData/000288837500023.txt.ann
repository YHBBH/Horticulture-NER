The host range and molecular variation of several Iranian isolates of [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) were investigated.
Of 1,119 symptomatic [$cucurbit #Plant*]samples and one symptomatic [$weed#Plant*] species (Colocynth; [$Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*]) collected from 13 Iranian provinces, 430 samples were [$ZYMV#Virus*]-infected as indicated by [$DAS-ELISA#Method*].
Twenty one viral isolates were chosen for biological and molecular characterizations based on their host range and geographical distribution.
Based on biological properties, the isolates clustered in three groups.
Isolates of group I and II, induced similar symptoms on [$watermelon#Plant*], [$Chenopodium quinoa#Plant*] and [@C.amaranticolor#Plant*], whereas isolates of group m produced different symptoms.
The complete [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene, the N-terminal coding region of the [$CP#Gene*] gene and the C-terminal part of the polymerase gene (Nib) of the 21 isolates were amplified by [$PCR#Method*], cloned and sequenced.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] using the 836 bp fragment comprising the complete [$CP#Gene*] gene and the 250 bp of NIb-[$CP#Gene*] fragment showed that [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates clustered in three groups.
Iranian isolates belonged to group I which was divided into two subgroups, I(A) and I(B).
