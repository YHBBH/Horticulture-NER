[@Grafted watermelon#Plant*] is a combination of two plants, a[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstock and a [$watermelon#Plant*] scion.
Therefore, [$weed#Plant*] control for this [$crop#Plant*] faces a unique problem: the safety of the selected herbicide has to be tested for both plants that make up the grafted plant.
In the current study, we evaluated the usage safety of selected herbicides for [@Cucurbita rootstocks#Plant*] as well as for non-grafted and grafted [$watermelons#Plant*], and the control of [$Amaranthus retroflexus#Plant*] by the same herbicides.
In addition, the residual effect of the herbicides was tested for seeded and transplanted [$melons#Plant*] representing the next [$crop#Plant*] following cultivation of the grafted [$watermelons#Plant*].
The herbicides ethalfluralin, pendimethalin, ethalfluralin, sulfentrazone, oxyfluorfen, chlorsulfuron and clomazone were chosen for their potential to control [$A.retroflexus#Plant*].
Pendimethalin and trifluralin were less effective than the other herbicides in controlling [$A.retroflexus#Plant*]; sulfentrazone, chlorsulfuron and clomazone were not safe for use on the tested [$cucurbits#Plant*] and thus cannot be recommended for [$weed#Plant*] control in grafted [$watermelons#Plant*].
Therefore, by eliminating the herbicides that are toxic to [$cucurbits#Plant*] and those that are ineffective for [$A.retroflexus#Plant*] control, it was concluded that the herbicides ethalfluralin and oxyfluorfen can be considered effective and safe for [$weed#Plant*] control in grafted [$watermelons#Plant*].
It was shown that trifluralin and oxyfluorfen have the potential to be applied effectively through the drip irrigation system.
