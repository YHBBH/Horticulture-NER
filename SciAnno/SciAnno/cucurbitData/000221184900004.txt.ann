[@Papaya ring spot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) causes major diseases in [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] in the Indian sub-continent that result in significant yield losses.
Molecular characterization of the [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene of a South Indian strain (lNP-UAS) of [$PRSV#Virus*]-P revealed an open reading frame of 849 bp that encoded the putative [$coat protein#Gene*] of 283 amino acids (GenBank Acc No.
AF528190).
The DAG triplet associated with aphid transmissibility and the potential protease cleavage site Q/S, located in the N-terminus of the INP-UAS [$CP#Gene*], were conserved, as has been reported for other [$PRSV#Virus*] [$coat proteins#Gene*].
The sequence had a deletion of 24 nucleotides that corresponded to eight amino acids in the N-terminal region of the [$CP#Gene*].
A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the INP-UAS [$CP#Gene*] with those reported for other [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates showed that the N-termini were variable and suggested that the distinctiveness of INP-UAS was linked to its geographical location.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] also showed that the INP-UAS strain [$coat protein#Gene*] gene was relatively divergent from those of other [$PRSV#Virus*]-P isolates as it formed a separate and distinct group.
The implications of sequence variability for the use of [$CP#Gene*]-genes in the development of [$transgenic plants#Plant*] for viral resistance are discussed.
