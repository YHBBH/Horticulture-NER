[@Pumpkin#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]([@Cucurbita L.spp.#Plant*]) are important [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] and are grown in almost all arable regions of the world.
The three economically important species, [@Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*], [@Cucurbita moschata Duchesne#Plant*], and [@Cucurbita maxima Duchesne#Plant*] are highly polymorphic in fruit characteristics, inspiring much research into their inheritance.
A comprehensive list of genes for[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] was last published more than a decade ago.
This new gene list for [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]includes descriptions of gene interactions and the genetic background of the parents that had been used for crossing to allow easy confirmation of previous work and provide a sound foundation for further investigation.
This gene list includes 79 loci for phenotypic/morphological traits and 48 polymorphic allozyme loci.
Linkage and mapping are discussed.
