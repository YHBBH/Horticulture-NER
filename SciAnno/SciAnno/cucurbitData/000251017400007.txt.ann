A new [@tobamo-like virus#Virus*] was isolated from a greenhouse-grown [$cucumber#Plant*] that showed severe mosaic distortion on leaves and fruit, in the southern part of Japan.
The virus was tentatively designated [@Cucumber mottle virus#Virus*] ([@CuMoV#Virus*]) and further characterized.
The size and antigenicity of the [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) and the complete sequence of the genome were compared with those of the known [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$tobamoviruses#Virus*]: the W and SH strains of [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), the C and Y strains of [$Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$KGMMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CFMMV#Virus*]), and [$Zucchini green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZGMMV#Virus*]).
The [$CP#Gene*] of [$CuMoV#Virus*] migrated more slowly than those of [$CGMMV#Virus*]-W and -SH and [$KGMMV#Virus*]-C and -Y in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide [$gel electrophoresis#Method*].
In [$Western blot analysis#Method*], the [$CP#Gene*] of [$CuMoV#Virus*] cross-reacted weakly with antisera against [$CGMMV#Virus*]-W and did not react with antisera against [$KGMMV#Virus*]-Y.
The overall nucleotide sequence of [$CuMoV#Virus*] had 62.5 to 63.5% identity with those of [$CGMMV#Virus*]-W, -SH, [$KGMMV#Virus*]-Y, [$CFMMV#Virus*], and [$ZGMMV#Virus*].
The genome organization was characteristic of [$tobamoviruses#Virus*], encoding a 131-kb protein, a 188-kb protein, a movement protein (MP), and [$CP#Gene*] in 5' to 3' order.
In the [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of the [$CP#Gene*], [$CuMoV#Virus*] was placed in a separate lineage from [$CGMMV#Virus*]-W, -SH, [$KGMMV#Virus*]-C, -Y, [$CFMMV#Virus*], and [$ZGMMV#Virus*].
The results indicate that [$CuMoV#Virus*] is a distinct [$tobamovirus species#Virus*] which represents a third sub-subgroup in the [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$tobamoviruses#Virus*].
