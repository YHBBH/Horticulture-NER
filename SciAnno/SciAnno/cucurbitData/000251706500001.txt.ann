Yield data for the major [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] in the United States have been collected and summarized.
Yield trends are presented for [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], processing and fresh-market), [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]; [$muskmelon#Plant*] and [$honeydew#Plant*]), and [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) for the period 1951-2005.
Data have been obtained from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, as originally reported by six of its units: Agricultural Marketing Service, Agricultural Research Service, Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Economic Statistics Service, National Agricultural Statistics Service, and Statistical Reporting Service.
For all [$crops#Plant*] yields have been increasing over time, except for processing [$cucumber#Plant*], for which yields seem to have reached a plateau by the end of the 1990s.
