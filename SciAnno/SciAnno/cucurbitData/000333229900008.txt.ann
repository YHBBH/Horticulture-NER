Sex expression is an important trait in [@watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]), in which monoecious, andromonoecious, and trimonoecious forms are present.
The andromonoecious trait is highly undesirable in [$watermelon#Plant*] breeding programs because it would require emasculation during hybrid development.
In contrast to other [$cucurbits#Plant*] such as [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) in which the genes involved in sex expression are well described and have been cloned, only the inheritance of the a gene associated with the andromonoecious trait has been described in [$watermelon#Plant*].
We used an intersubspecific [$C.lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*] x [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] F-2 population to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with percent male (%M), percent female (%F), percent hermaphrodite (%HM), and percent female of pistillate [%F/P (female hermaphrodite)] flowers.
Four chromosomal regions were identified that were associated with sex expression in [$watermelon#Plant*].
Major QTL for %F, %HM, and %F/P were colocalized on linkage group 11A and explained 31.3% to 37.7% of the phenotypic variation observed for the three traits.
These QTL are suggested to be the location of the a gene in [$watermelon#Plant*].
Markers linked to two of the four QTL identified were located within 1 Mb of a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase ([$ACS#Gene*]) gene on the [$watermelon#Plant*] draft genome.
[$ACS#Gene*] genes play a key role in sex expression in [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] and these genes are therefore candidate genes for further studies to elucidate this trait in another economically important [$cucurbit #Plant*][$crop#Plant*].
The QTL and candidate genes identified in the present study lay the foundation for marker-assisted selection for sex expression traits in [$watermelon#Plant*].
