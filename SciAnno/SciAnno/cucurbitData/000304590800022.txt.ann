[@Begonia plants #Virus*]([@Begonia semperflorens Link & Otto#Virus*]) with chlorotic ringspot symptoms on the leaves were found in Taichung, Chinese Taipei.
Isolation of the virus was conducted by single-lesion transfers on [$Chenopodium quinoa#Plant*] by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*].
Chlorotic spots appeared 7-10 days after inoculation.
Back inoculation with an isolated virus culture to virus-free begonia confirmed the [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of the virus to begonia.
Electron microscopic examinations revealed flexuous rod-shaped virus particles of 750x13 nm in the crude sap from infected plants and purified virus preparations.
Typical inclusion bodies of [$potyviruses#Virus*] were also observed in ultrathin sections of infected tissues from [@begonia#Plant*], [$squash #Plant*]and [$C.quinoa#Plant*].
[$Serological tests#Method*], including [@indirect-ELISA and western blotting#Method*], indicated that the isolated virus was serologically related to [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
The virus caused local le[$sions#Plant*] on inoculated leaves of [$C.quinoa#Plant*], systemic mosaic in [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), [$zucchini#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) and [$Cucumis metuliferus#Plant*], and chlorotic ringspots in [$begonia#Plant*].
The symptoms caused in [$cucurbits#Plant*] by the [$begonia#Plant*] isolate were much milder than those caused by [$ZYMV#Virus*]s of [$cucurbit #Plant*]origin.
Complementary DNA fragments derived from viral genomic RNAs were cloned, sequenced, and the full-length sequence was submitted to the EMBL database (AM422386).
The genomic RNA consists of 9591 nucleotides excluding the poly-A tail and contains an identical genome organization as those reported for members of the [$genus Potyvirus#Virus*].
The nucleotide sequence of the full-length genome and the deduced amino acid sequence of the [$coat protein#Gene*] share 98% identity to those of [$ZYMV#Virus*]-CU (AJ307036), [$ZYMV#Virus*]-SG (AJ316228), and [$ZYMV#Virus*]-TW-TN3 (AF127929).
This is the first observation of natural [$ZYMV#Virus*]-infection in [$begonia#Plant*].
