In the early 1890s a [@mysterious wilt disease #Disease*]of [$watermelon#Plant*] was causing heavy losses in the southern United States.
E.F.
Smith began the seminal research on what became only the second plant wilt disease described, [$Fusarium wilt of watermelon#Disease*], caused by the soilborne [$fungus#Virus*] [@Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*].
Within a few years, Smith characterized and named the casual agent, established its [$pathogenicity#Plant*] and host specificity and performed detailed histological studies on the transport of micro[$conidia#Virus*] within the xylem and the formation of 'embolisms' (tyloses), a characteristic later shown to be common to all [$Fusarium#Virus*] [$vascular wilt#Disease*]s.
Almost immediately, W.A.
Orton began hybridization studies to develop a wilt-resistant [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivar; a concept that at the time was not fully embraced by the scientific community.
Over the ensuing decades, numerous breeders improved upon wilt-resistant cultivars and, by the 1950s, the disease was well controlled throughout much of the US and other countries.
Resistance, however, was not universal and, in some areas, cultivars succumbed to wilt.
Physiologic specialization (races) of [@F.o.f.sp.niveum#Virus*] was investigated as early as 1934, as well as host specificity and the concept of formae speciales (f.sp.).
The appearance of new races has been a subject of great interest for years and continues to spark debate.
Methods to identify and distinguish among the various formae speciales and races, including vegetative compatibility and numerous molecular techniques, continue to generate interest, although inoculation of differential cultivars is still the primary means of identifying [$pathogen#Virus*]ic isolates and races.
[$F.o.f.sp.niveum#Virus*] was one of the first [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] [$pathogens#Virus*] to be associated with seed, a problem that still exists today.
Numerous other control strategies have been investigated over the last 60 years and include nutritional, cultural, and biological methods, but none have replaced genetic resistance as the preferred method of control.
Recent research has focused on several main areas including a better understanding of the inheritance of wilt resistance, sequencing and mapping the [$watermelon#Plant*] genome and the development of race 2-resistant varieties derived from the highly resistant PI 296341-FR germplasm.
Additional investigations into the histological, molecular, genetic and biochemical mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility are improving our understanding of this tenacious disease.
While it has been almost 120 years since Smith first described [$Fusarium wilt of watermelon#Disease*], it continues to be a significant cause of economic losses in [$watermelon#Plant*] production around the world.
