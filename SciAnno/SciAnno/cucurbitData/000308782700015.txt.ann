Experiments at two sites during two years evaluated the selectivity of preemergence fomesafen in [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] of winter and[$ summer squash#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*], [$cantaloupe#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [$pumpkin#Plant*].
[$Cucumber#Plant*]s were the most sensitive of the [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] to fomesafen and produced little or no fruit in two out of three experiments when applied at 0.28 kg ai ha(-1).
Fomesafen also reduced [$cantaloupe#Plant*] yield.
Visual damage was noted on the other [$crops#Plant*] tested, but [$crop#Plant*] yield was not impacted by fomesafen at 0.28 -0.35 kg ai ha(-1).
With the exception of [$cucumbers#Plant*], injury caused by fomesafen to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] was transitory even when fomesafen-treated soil splashed onto the leaves of emerging [$cucurbits#Plant*] during a powerful thunderstorm at one of the test sites.
Control of[@ redroot pigweed#Plant*] ([$Amaranthus retroflexus#Plant*]), [@Powell amarant #Plant*]([@Amaranthus powellii#Plant*]) and other [@Amaranthus spp.#Plant*], [@lambsquarters#Plant*] ([$Chenopodium album#Plant*]), [@hairy nightshade#Plant*] ([@Solanum physafolium#Plant*]), [@common purslane#Plant*] ([@Portulaca oleraceae#Plant*]), and [@velvetleaf #Plant*]([@Abutilon theophrastii#Plant*]) ranged from 92 to 100% with fomesafen applied at 0.28 kg ai ha(-1).
The excellent efficacy on these difficult to control [$weed#Plant*] species suggests that lower rates of fomesafen may be appropriate and improve [$crop#Plant*] tolerance, particularly if fomesafen is tankmix-applied with other preemergence [$herbicides#Plant*] such as s-metolachlor or dimethenamid-p.
Weed control with these combinations was excellent for all [$weed#Plant*] species in these experiments.
