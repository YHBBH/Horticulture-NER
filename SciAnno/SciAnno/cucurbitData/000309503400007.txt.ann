In 2008 and 2009, samples of [@melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]), [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus Thumb#Plant*]), [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]), and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) plants, as well as specimens of [@white fly#Virus*] ([@Bemisia tabaci Germ.#Virus*]) from different regions in the states of Nuevo Leon, Coahuila and Durango, Mexico, were collected.
After RNA isolation, the samples were analyzed by [@RT-PCR using specific primers to amplify p22, heat shock and capsid proteins#Method*], for the [@cucurbit yellows stunt disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]).
[$CYSDV#Virus*] virus was detected in [$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$white fly#Virus*] collected in several regions.
Twenty-six samples turned out to be positive for the [$CYSDV#Virus*] virus out of 129[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae plants in the tree states studied of the North-Central of Mexico.
The [$PCR#Method*] products were cloned and sequenced, and then compared with the available sequences of the GenBank.
Sequences obtained from the positive samples had 96 to 100% of similarity with samples from the United States, Spain and other countries.
