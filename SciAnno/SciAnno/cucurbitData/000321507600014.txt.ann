Based on the observation that [@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] switches from saprobic to [$pathogen#Virus*]ic growth for seed-to-seedling transmission of [$bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]), we hypothesized that quorum sensing (QS) was involved in the regulation of this process.
[@Using aacI (luxI homologue) and aacR (luxR homologue) mutants of AAC00-1#Method*], we investigated the role of QS in [$watermelon#Plant*] seed colonization and seed-to-seedling transmission of [$BFB#Disease*].
aacR and aacI mutants of AAC00-1 colonized germinating [$watermelon#Plant*] seed at wild-type levels; however, [$BFB#Disease*] seed-to-seedling transmission was affected in a cell density-dependent manner.
There were no significant differences in [$BFB#Disease*] seedling transmission between [$watermelon#Plant*] seed infiltrated with approxi[$mate#Plant*]ly 1x10(6) CFU of AAC00-1, the aacR or aacI deletion mutants (95.2, 94.9 and 98.3% [$BFB#Disease*] incidence, respectively).
In contrast, when seed inoculum was reduced to approximately 1x10(3) CFU/seed, [$BFB#Disease*] seed-to-seedling transmission [$decline#Disease*]d to 34.3% for the aacI mutant, which was significantly less than the wild type (78.6%).
Interestingly, [$BFB#Disease*] seed-to-seedling transmission for the aacR mutant was not significantly different to the wild-type strain.
These data suggest that QS plays a role in regulation of genes involved in seed-to-seedling transmission of [$BFB#Disease*].
