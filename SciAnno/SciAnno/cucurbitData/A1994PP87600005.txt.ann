 The [@cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) is a new tentative member of the [$luteovirus#Virus*] group which is transmitted persistently by [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] and [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*].
   In [$muskmelon#Plant*] plants, mixed infection with [$CABYV#Virus*] and [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) induced an increase in [$CABYV#Virus*] concentration estimated by double antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]), which was maximum after 3 weeks of co-infection.
   Assays, conducted with other [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts and sap-transmissible viruses showed that a similar increase occurred with most of the [$potyviruses#Virus*] tested.
However, [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) and [$squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]) were inefficient (or less efficient than [$potyviruses#Virus*]) in increasing [$CABYV#Virus*] concentration.
   Aphid transmission experiments were conducted to check whether increased virus multiplication could either enhance transmission rates or modify the mode of [$CABYV#Virus*] acquisition by aphids.
However, when [$A.gossypii#Virus*] was used, no increases in [$CABYV#Virus*] transmissibility nor in its acquisition mode were detected.
