The pathogenicity of [@Acremonium cucurbitacearum#Virus*] to 31 [$cucurbits#Plant*], 18 [$crop#Plant*] plant species, and 15 [$weed#Plant*] species was evaluated under greenhouse conditions.
This study demonstrates that many other [$cucurbits#Plant*] in addition to muskmelon and watermelon can potentially serve as hosts of A.
[$cucurbit#Plant*]acearum.
Using a [@disease severity index (DSI)#Method*], all [@muskmelon#Plant* and [@watermelon#Plant*] cultivars were ranked as susceptible or highly susceptible, with the exception of [@honeydew#Plant*] cultivar TAM Dew Improved, which ranked resistant in one study.
Highly resistant [$cucurbits#Plant*] included [@Cucurbita maxima #Plant*]([@autumn squash#Plant*]), [$Luffa acutangula#Plant*], [@L.aegyptiaca#Plant*] ([@sponge gourd#Plant*]) and [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*] ([@ash gourd#Plant*]).
[$Cyclanthera pedata#Plant*] and [@Cucumis miriocarpus#Plant*] were rated as resistant.
The percentage recovery of [@A.cucurbitacearum#Plant*] ranged from 8% to 100% and tended to be higher in plants with a higher [@DSI#Method*].
Other [$crops#Plant*] and [$weed#Plant*] species common to [$muskmelon#Plant*] production fields are not likely to be involved in the perpetuation or propagation of the fungus.
