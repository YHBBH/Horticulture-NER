[@Sicyos australis#Plant*] is New Zealand's only native [@cucurbit#Plant*] and is a rare, endangered species.
It has been suggested that viruses, introduced to New Zealand with [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], may be a contributing factor to its [$decline#Disease*] over the last 50 years.
[$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ( [$ZYMV#Virus*]) are important viruses of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], and are present together with their aphid vectors in New Zealand.
This study investigated the effects of infection by these viruses on [@S.australis#Plant*] growth, and the incidence of [$cucurbit#Plant*] virus diseases in remnant populations of [$S.australis#Plant*].
Experimental infections with [$CMV#Virus*] isolates NZ100 and NZ119 caused severe symptoms that appeared 2-3 weeks post-inoculation.
Symptoms included leaf distortion, mosaic, vein chlorosis, reduced leaf size and a general reduction in growth of up to 72% for [$CMV#Virus*] NZ100 and up to 65% for [$CMV#Virus*] NZ119.
[$ZYMV#Virus*] infection resulted in mild symptoms that developed within 3 weeks post-inoculation and caused no significant growth reduction.
An [$ELISA#Method*] survey in remnant populations of [$S.australis#Plant*] detected [$ZYMV#Virus*] and [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) at 5 and 3 sites, respectively, while [$CMV#Virus*] was detected only once.
The identification of [$CMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] in these populations was confirmed by [$RT-PCR#Method*].
The [$ZYMV#Virus*] product was sequenced, demonstrating that [$S.australis#Plant*] is a natural host of these viruses.
