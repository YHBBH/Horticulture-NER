[@Cytogenetic mapping of DNA markers#Method*] provides insights into a species' basic genomic structure and facilitates the deduction of phylogenetic relationships between related species.
The [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] has numerous economically and medicinally important [$crop#Plant*] species.
In addition, [@wild Cucurbitaceae species#Plant*] can provide important genetic resources for [$crop#Plant*] improvement.
However, cytogenetic information for many species is still insufficient.
Here, triple-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on four Korean [$wild Cucurbitaceae species#Plant*] of [@Actinostemma tenerum Grift#Plant*], [@Thladiantha dubia Bunge#Plant*], [@Sechium edule (Jacq.) Swartz#Plant*], and [@Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino#Plant*] using 5S rDNA, 45S rDNA, and telomeric- re[$pea#Plant*]t probes.
The chromosome numbers of the four species were 2n = 2x = 16, 18, 28, and 2n = 6x = 66, respectively.
The four species have relatively small chromosomes, ranging from 2.16 to 5.38 mu m.
One 5S and three 45S rDNA signals were observed in T.dubia, with one colocalization on a satellite chromosome (1:3:1), while signal patterns were 1:1:0, 1:3:0, and 4:5:0 for [@A.tenerum#Plant*], [@S.edule#Plant*], and [@G.pentaphyllum#Plant*], respectively.
Compared with that of 5S rDNA, 45S rDNA localization was more distal, except on chromosome 8 of [$A.tenerum#Plant*] and chromosomes 2 and 3 of [$S.edule#Plant*].
The species exhibited telomeric signals on the chromosomal terminal region, while additional signals hybridized on the pericentromeric region in [$A.tenerum#Plant*] chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
These results will contribute to elucidating phylogenetic relationships among[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae species and improve on-going[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae breeding programs.
