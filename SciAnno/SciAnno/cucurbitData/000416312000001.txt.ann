Drought, cold and salinity are the major environmental stresses that limit agricultural productivity.
NAC transcription factors regulate the stress response in plants.
[$Pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]) is an important [$cucurbit #Plant*][$vegetable#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] and it has strong resistance to abiotic stress; however, the biological functions of stress-related [@NAC genes#Gene*] in this [$crop#Plant*] are largely unknown.
This study reports the function of CmNAC1, a stress-responsive [$pumpkin#Plant*] NAC domain protein.
The [@CmNAC1#Gene*]-GFP fusion protein was transiently expressed in [$tobacco#Plant*] leaves for subcellular localization analysis, and we found that [$CmNAC1#Gene*] is localized in the nucleus.
Transactivation assay in yeast cells revealed that [$CmNAC1#Gene*] functions as a transcription activator, and its transactivation domain is located in the C-terminus.
[$CmNAC1#Gene*] was ubiquitously expressed in different organs, and its transcript was induced by salinity, cold, dehydration, H2O2, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
Furthermore, the ectopic expression (EE) of [$CmNAC1#Gene*] in [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] led to ABA hypersensitivity and enhanced tolerance to salinity, drought and cold stress.
In addition, five ABA-responsive elements were enriched in [$CmNAC1#Gene*] promoter.
The [$CmNAC1#Gene*]-EE plants exhibited different root architecture, leaf morphology, and significantly high concentration of ABA compared with WT [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] under normal conditions.
Our results indicated that [$CmNAC1#Gene*] is a critical factor in ABA signaling pathways and it can be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve the abiotic stress tolerance of [$crops#Plant*].
