Protected cultivation of vegetables offers distinct advantages of quality, productivity and favourable market price to the growers.
Vegetable growers can substantially increase their income by protected cultivation of [$vegetables#Plant*] in off-season as the [$vegetables#Plant*] produced during their normal season generally do not fetch good returns due to large availability of these [$vegetable#Plant*] in the markets.
Off-season cultivation of [$cucurbits#Plant*] under low plastic tunnels is one of the most profitable technologies under northern plains of India.
Walk-in tunnels are also suitable and effective to raise off-season nursery and off-season [$vegetable#Plant*] cultivation due to their low initial cost.
Insect proof net houses can be used for virus-free cultivation of [$tomato#Plant*], chilli, [$sweet pepper#Plant*] and other [$vegetables#Plant*] mainly during the rainy season.
These low cost structures are also suitable for growing pesticide-free green [$vegetables#Plant*].
Low cost greenhouses can be used for high quality [$vegetable#Plant*] cultivation for long duration (6 - 10 months) mainly in peri-urban areas of the country to fetch commensurate p[$rice#Plant*] of produces.
Polytrenches have proved extremely useful for growing [$vegetables#Plant*] under cold desert conditions in upper reaches of Himalayas in the country.
