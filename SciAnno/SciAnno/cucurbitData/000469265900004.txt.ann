[@Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB)#Disease*] caused by [@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] is one of the most important bacterial diseases of [$cucurbits#Plant*] worldwide.
However, the mechanisms associated with [$A.citrulli #Virus*][$pathogenicity#Plant*] and genetics of host resistance have not been extensively investigated.
We idenitfied [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*] and [$Nicotiana tabacum#Plant*] as surrogate hosts for studying [$A.citrulli #Virus*]pathogenicity and non-host resistance triggered by type III secreted (T3S) effectors.
Two [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains, M6 and AAC00-1, that represent the two major groups amongst [$A.citrulli #Virus*]populations, induced disease symptoms on N.benthamiana, but triggered a hypersensitive response (HR) on [$N.tabacum#Plant*] plants.
Transient expression of 19 T3S effectors from [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in N.benthamiana leaves revealed that three effectors, Aave_1548, Aave_2708, and Aave_2166, trigger water-soaking-like cell death in N.benthamiana.
Aave_1548 knockout mutants of M6 and AAC00-1 displayed reduced virulence on N.benthamiana and [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]).
Transient expression of Aave_1548 and Aave_2166 effectors triggered a non-host HR in N.
tabacum, which was dependent on the functionality of the immune signalling component, NtSGT1.
Hence, employing [$Nicotiana#Plant*] species as surrogate hosts for studying [$A.citrulli #Virus*]pathogenicity may help characterize the function of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]T3S effectors and facilitate the development of new strategies for [$BFB#Disease*] management.
