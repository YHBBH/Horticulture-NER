Three trials were conducted to evaluate the growth and yield responses of [@summer squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]) to N rates.
Preplant fertilizer rates were 50,100,150,200,250, and 300 lb/acre of N.
In Ruskin, [$summer squash#Plant*] plant vigor increased linearly with N rate.
However, this constant increase in vigor did not reflect on total yield, which sharply increased between 50 and 100 lb/acre of N, remaining stable afterwards.
In Balm, a linear equation characterized the effect of N rates on plant vigor.
However, this response was not expressed as increased total yield, since there was no significant N rate effect.
At all N rates and in both locations, petiole sap N-NO3 readings at 8 weeks after treatment (WAT) ranged from approximately 700 to 2000 ppm, which are within sufficiency levels for the [$crop#Plant*].
These results indicated that between 50 and 100 lb/acre of N could be sufficient to maximize [$summer squash#Plant*] production, depending on potential amounts of N in the soil from previous growing seasons.
In this particular case, the estimated N release (ENR) potential of Ruskin soils, which was determined through wet-ashing of the organic matter, was only 25 lb/acre, whereas the ENR in the two Balm sites were 45 and 75 lb/acre of N.
It is suggested, as an appropriate nutrient management practice, perform soil analysis prior to planting [$summer squash#Plant*] as a double [$crop#Plant*] to estimate residual N amounts and consequently adjusting N application rates.
