The [@Dacine fruit fly fauna#Virus*] ([$Tephritidae: Dacinae#Virus*]) present in Palau, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Guam,Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI), Marshall Islands and Kiribati is reviewed.
Two species are native to these countries.
Mango [@fruit fly#Virus*], Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Schiner), is a widespread pest species but is absent from Guam and CNMI.
B.
ochrosiae (Malloch), a non-economic species, is endemic to Guam and CNMI.
Melon ny, B.
[$cucurbit#Plant*]ae (Coquillet), a major pest of [$Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], has been present on Guam since 1936 and CNMI since 1943.
It was eradicated from CNMI by [$the sterile insect technique#Method*] ([$SIT#Method*]) in 1962-63, but was re-introduced from Guam in 1981.
It was also discovered on Christmas Island in Kiribati in 1987, but presumably eradicated by a two year interruption of [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*]ping.
Oriental [$fruit fly#Virus*] (B.
dorsalis Hendel) was also introduced to CNMI before 1935 and Guam in 1948.
Male annihilation, protein bail spraying and [$SIT#Method*] resulted in eradication of the species.
It has been absent from Guam and CNMI since 1965.
Oriental [$fruit fly#Virus*] has recently been discovered in Palau.
II has probably been present there since 1995;[$Bread#Plant*][$fruit fly#Virus*], B.
umbrosa ([$Fabricius#Virus*]), is a pest of Artocarpus spp present in Palau.
[$Quarantine surveillance#Method*], to detect incursions of exotic fruit ny species by trapping, is operational in CNMI, Guam, FSM and Gilbert Islands of Kiribati.
