In [@cucurbits#Plant*], phloem latex exudes from cut sieve tubes of the extrafascicular phloem (EFP), serving in defense against herbivores.
We analyzed inducible defense mechanisms in the EFP of [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]) after leaf damage.
As an early systemic response, wounding elicited transient accumulation of jasmonates and a decrease in exudation probably due to partial sieve tube occlusion by callose.
The energy status of the EFP was enhanced as indicated by increased levels of ATP, phosphate, and intermediates of the citric acid cycle.
Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry also revealed that sucrose transport, gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, and amino acid metabolism were up-regulated after wounding.
Combining ProteoMiner technology for the enrichment of low-abundance proteins with stable isotope-coded protein labeling, we identified 51 wound-regulated phloem proteins.
Two Sucrose-Nonfermenting1-related protein kinases and a 32-kD 14-3-3 protein are candidate central regulators of stress metabolism in the EFP.
Other proteins, such as the Silverleaf Whitefly-Induced Protein1, Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase6, and Heat Shock Protein81, have known defensive functions.
Isotope-coded protein labeling and western-blot analyses indicated that Cyclophilin18 is a reliable marker for stress responses of the EFP.
As a hint toward the induction of redox signaling, we have observed delayed oxidation-triggered polymerization of the major Phloem Protein1 ([$PP1#Gene*]) and [$PP2#Gene*], which correlated with a [$decline#Disease*] in carbonylation of [$PP2#Gene*].
In sum, wounding triggered transient sieve tube occlusion, enhanced energy metabolism, and accumulation of defense-related proteins in the [$pumpkin#Plant*] EFP.
The systemic wound response was mediated by jasmonate and redox signaling.
