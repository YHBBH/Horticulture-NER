[@Phytophthora blight#Disease*], caused by [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*], is one of the most destructive diseases worldwide that affects [@Capsicum pepper#Plant*].
Attempts to provide universally resistant cultivars has been unsuccessful, which may be the result of the use of different resistance sources, pathotypes, or races of [$P.capsici#Plant*] isolates and screening techniques.
The screening method used at Embrapa Vegetables in Brazil to detect resistance to [$P.capsici#Plant*] in [@Capsicum#Plant*] was compared with the screening method used at New Mexico State University.
Both screening methods produced similar and consistent results when a range of [$P.capsici#Plant*] isolates were used.
It was concluded that either method can successfully differentiate resistant and susceptible individuals.
In addition, 20 [$P.capsici#Plant*] isolates from Brazil were characterized for virulence using a subset of 26 New Mexico recombinant inbred lines of [$pepper#Plant*] ([$Capsicum annum#Plant*]).
Within the [$P.capsici#Plant*] populations from Brazil, eight new physiological races for the [@root rot disease#Disease*] syndrome were identified.
A total of nine isolates were [$pathogen#Virus*]ic only on the susceptible control, 'Camelot'.
The ability to identify physiological races of [$P.capsici#Plant*] occurring in Brazil allows for a better understanding about race-specific resistance leading to improved approaches in breeding for durable resistant cultivars.
