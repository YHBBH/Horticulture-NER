[@Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]) causes viral [$watermelon vine decline#Method*].
To facilitate detection of [$SqVYV#Virus*], enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay ([$ELISA#Method*]) and quantitative [$reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$qRT-PCR#Method*]) diagnostic methods were developed.
Both methods were capable of detecting [$SqVYV#Virus*] in a wide range of [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts.
[$ELISA#Method*] was able to detect virus in infected host tissue diluted to at least 1:2,560, which was sufficient for detection in symptomatic [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*] plants.
The [$qRT-PCR#Method*] method was capable of reliably detecting as few as 3.4 copies of a cloned fragment of [$SqVYV#Virus*] genomic RNA with an average cycle threshold (CO value of 36.4.
The sensitivities and specificities for each detection method were esti[$mate#Plant*]d by latent class analysis for a set of inoculated [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*] plants at two sampling scales.
The scales were hierarchical, with individual plants representing the upper scale and samples from the plant representing the lower scale.
The number of samples per plant varied from 1 to 8, and a plant was diagnosed positive if any of its samples tested positive.
For all analyses, a cutoff C-t of 35 was chosen for [$qRT-PCR#Method*], which is approxi[$mate#Plant*]ly 2.5 cycles lower than the lowest C-t value achieved for mock-inoculated plants (presumed to be a false positive).
[$qRT-PCR#Method*] showed high sensitivities (>= 0.99) at both sampling scales for [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*], whereas the sensitivities for [$ELISA#Method*] ranged from 0.58 to 0.76.
The specificities for both tests were very similar (>= 0.94), with [$ELISA#Method*] sometimes outperforming [$qRT-PCR#Method*].
These diagnostic methods provide additional tools for the identification of [$SqVYV#Virus*] and management of [$SqVYV#Virus*]-induced [$watermelon vine decline#Method*].
