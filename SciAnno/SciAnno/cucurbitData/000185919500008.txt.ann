[@Rhizopycnis vagum#Virus*] is a recently described coelomycete known to belong to the complex of [@root rot pathogens#Virus*] contributing to [@vine#Plant*] decline of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in several parts of the world.
However, the [$fungus#Virus*] has also been reported to infect [$tomato#Plant*], and as an endophytic associate of mycorrhizal roots of wild, asymptomatic [@Pinus halepensis#Plant*] and [@Rosmarinus officinalis#Plant*] plants in Italy.
To accelerate epidemiological and ecological investigations on this [$fungus#Virus*], a [@PCR primer pair#Method*] was developed.
Primers Rv1-F and Rv1-R were designed, based on alignment of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), which amplified a 396-bp fragment from all [@R.vagum#Virus*] isolates tested, including isolates [$pathogen#Virus*]ic to [$melons#Plant*] and endophytic isolates from mycorrhizae.
Specificity of the primer pair was verified both in silico ( BLAST searches using each primer string as a query) and in [@PCR assays#Method*], where the primers failed to amplify DNA from any isolate of fungi taxonomically related to [$R.vagum#Virus*] (e.g.[@Massarina walkeri#Virus*] and [@Stagonospora spp.#Virus*]) and other [$vine#Plant*] [$decline#Disease*] and common [@soilborne pathogens#Virus*] (e.g.[@Monasporascus cannonballus#Virus*], [$Acremonium cucurbitacearum#Virus*], [$Fusarium spp#Virus*].
and [$Rhizoctonia solani#Virus*]).
Under optimum conditions, detectable amplification of the specific sequence required 0.05 pg of target DNA.
Amplification of the expected 369-bp fragment was also obtained from DNA root extracts of nearly asymptomatic [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] plants inoculated with [$R.vagum#Virus*] under greenhouse conditions.
