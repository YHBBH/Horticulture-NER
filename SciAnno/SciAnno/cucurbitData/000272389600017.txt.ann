Four cultivars of each of three [@cucurbit species #Plant*]were used to examine the effects of pollen-load (i.e., the number of pollen [@grains#Plant*] deposited on the stigma of pistillate flowers) on fruit-set, seed-set, and germinability (i.e., germination percentage and germination rate) in four [$greenhouse experiments#Method*].
Increasing pollen-load increased the number of fruit per plant in the four [$melon cultivars#Plant*] over two growing seasons, and in two non-parthenocarpic [$cucumbers#Plant*], but had no effect on all four [$squash #Plant*]cultivars.
In most cases, increasing pollen-load increased the number of fully-developed seeds, decreased the percentage of empty seeds, and tended to decrease mean seed weights.
On average, [$melons#Plant*] produced 2.2 fruits per plant in the Winter, and only 0.9 fruits per plant in the Autumn.
In contrast, [$melons#Plant*] produced 275 fully-developed seeds per fruit in the Autumn, but only 57 seeds in the Winter.
Mean [$melon#Plant*] seed weight was higher in Autumn, and the sum of all seed yield component effects resulted a significantly higher seed yield per plant in the Autumn.
Germinability of [$melon#Plant*] seeds from the Autumn season, and of [$squash #Plant*]seeds from the Winter season, were not significantly affected by pollen-load treatment.
These data are contrary to the theory that microgametophyte competition has a positive effect on the vigour of the progeny.
The lower germinability of [$melon#Plant*] seeds obtained by passive pollination (i.e., self-pollination in covered flowers) may be due to the fact that pollination without insect or human interference yielded only a few seeds per fruit, and, under such circumstances, there may be a survival advantage for slow and distributed germination.
