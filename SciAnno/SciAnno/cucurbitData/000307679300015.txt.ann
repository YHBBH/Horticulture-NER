[@Phytophthora blight#Disease*], caused by [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*], is a serious disease in [$vegetable#Plant*] production, and selective use of fungicides continues to be a significant component of disease management programs.
The effect of three chemical compounds-mandipropamid, dimethomorph, and cyazofamid-on asexual stages of [$P.capsici#Plant*] collected from [$bell pepper#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Georgia was assessed in this study.
Forty isolates of [$P.capsici#Plant*] were determined to be sensitive to mandipropamid and dimethomorph based on mycelial growth, zoospore germination, and sporangial production.
Concentrations that were 50% effective (EC50 values) of mandipropamid that inhibited mycelial growth, zoospore germination, and sporangial production of the isolates averaged 0.03, 5.70, and 0.02 mu g/ml, respectively.
EC50 values of dimethomorph in inhibiting mycelial growth, zoospore germination, and sporangial production averaged 0.24, 0.10, and 0.46 mu g/ml, respectively.
The majority of isolates were either resistant or intermediately sensitive to cyazofamid at 500 mu g/ml or lower concentrations based on mycelial growth or sporangial production, although all the isolates were sensitive to this compound based on zoospore germination, with an average EC50 of 0.04 mu g/ml.
The results indicated that [$P.capsici#Plant*] populations in Georgia have not developed resistance to mandipropamid and dimethomorph whereas, for the majority of the isolates, certain asexual stages were resistant to cyazofamid.
