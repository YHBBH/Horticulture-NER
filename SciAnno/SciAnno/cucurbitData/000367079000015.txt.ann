This study was conducted to establish an efficient screening method for [$watermelon#Plant*] plants resistant to [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] ([@FW#Disease*]), which is caused by [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] (Fon).
An HA isolate was prepared from a wilted [$watermelon#Plant*] plant in Haman-gun and identified as [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] based on [@morphological characteristics, molecular analyses of ITS (internal transcribed spacer) and TEF (translation elongation factor 1 alpha) sequences#Method*], and host specificity on [$cucurbits#Plant*] including [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$oriental melon#Plant*], and [$cucumber#Plant*].
The assay for disease response of [$watermelon#Plant*] differentials indicated that the HA isolate was race 0.
Among seven liquid media tested, the highest amount of Fon spores was produced from V8-juice broth, which was selected as a medium for mass production of Fon.
The disease assay for 21 [$watermelon#Plant*] and 11 [$watermelon#Plant*]-rootstock cultivars demonstrated that 20 [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*] except for 'Soknoranggul' were susceptible; 'Soknoranggul' was moderately resistant.
All the tested rootstock cultivars were highly resistant to the HA isolate.
The evaluation of disease development depending on various conditions suggested that an efficient screening method for [$FW#Disease*] resistance in [$watermelon#Plant*] plants is to dip the roots of 10-day-old [$seedlings#Plant*] in spore suspension of 1.0 x 10(5) - 1.0 x 10(6) [$conidia#Virus*].mL(-1) for 30 min., to transplant the [$seedlings#Plant*] to plastic pots with a fertilized soil, and then to cultivate the plants at 25 degrees C for 3 weeks.
