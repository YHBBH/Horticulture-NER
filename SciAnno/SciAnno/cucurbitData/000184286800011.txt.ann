[@Cucurbit yellow vine disease#Disease*] ([@CYVD#Disease*]), which can inflict heavy losses to [$watermelon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$cantaloupe#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]in U.S.
production areas from the midwest to northeastern states, causes phloem discoloration, foliar yellowing, wilting, and plant decline.
Bacteria were cultured from the phloem of crown sections of symptomatic plants of [@Citrullus lanatas#Plant*] and [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
Those bacteria testing positive in [$CYVD#Disease*]-specific [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) were all gram negative and appeared morphologically identical, producing creamy white, smooth, entire, convex colonies on Luria-Bertani or nutrient agar.
Characterized [$cucurbit#Plant*]-derived strains of [@Serratia marcescens#Virus*] were introduced into greenhouse-grown [$squash #Plant*]plants by puncture inoculation and into field-grown [$squash #Plant*]plants by enclosure with [@S.marcescens#Virus*]-fed [$squash bugs#Virus*], [$Anasa tristis#Virus*].
Up to 60% of the bacteria-inoculated plants in the greenhouse and up to 17% of field plants caged with inoculative [$squash bugs#Virus*] developed phloem discoloration and tested positive for [@S.marcescens#Virus*] by [$CYVD#Disease*]-specific [$PCR#Method*].
None of the controls developed phloem discoloration or tested positive by [$PCR#Method*].
Of the diseased field plants, 12% (2 of 35) also yellowed, wilted, and collapsed, exhibiting full symptom development of [$CYVD#Disease*].
However, neither plant collapse nor [$decline#Disease*] was observed in the greenhouse-grown, puncture-inoculated plants.
The morphology, growth habit, and [$PCR#Method*] reaction of bacteria cultured from crown tissue of a subset of plants in each experimental group were indistinguishable from those of the inoculum bacteria.
Evidence presented from our studies confirms that the [$squash #Plant*]bug can transmit S.
marcescens, the [$CYVD#Disease*] causal bacterium.
The [$S.marcescens#Virus*]-A.
tristis relationship described here is the first instance in which the [$squash #Plant*]bug has been identified as a vector of a plant [$pathogen#Virus*].
Our experiments represent a completion of the steps of Koch's postulates, demonstrating that [$S.marcescens#Virus*] is the causal agent of [$CYVD#Disease*] and that the [$squash #Plant*]bug, A.
tristis, is a vector of the [$pathogen#Virus*].
