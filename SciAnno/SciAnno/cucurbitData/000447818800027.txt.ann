A survey of foliar [$pathogens#Virus*] of [$watermelon#Plant*] based on two-stage cluster sampling was conducted on commercial farms in South Carolina in spring 2015, spring and fall 2016, and fall 2017.
In total, 60 fields from 27 different growers in seven counties representing the main [$watermelon#Plant*]-producing areas in the state were sampled, using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling approach.
In the sampling design, counties corresponded to strata, growers to first-stage clusters, and fields to second-stage clusters.
In each field, 100 symptomatic leaves were collected at five equidistant sampling points along four transects encompassing a square shape of 2,500 m(2).
After collection, [$pathogens#Virus*] were identified based on reproductive structures formed on leaves during >12 h incubation.
Estimates were obtained for the statewide probability of [$pathogen#Virus*] occurrence and associations between [$pathogen#Virus*] pairs.
Six [$fungal pathogens#Virus*], [$Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*], [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*], [@Cercospora citrullina#Virus*], [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], [@Myrothecium sensu lato (s.1.)#Virus*], and [@Corynespora cassiicola#Virus*]; the oomycete [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*]; and three viral [$pathogens#Virus*] were identified on the examined leaves.
With the exception of fall 2017, [@Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*]
was the most prevalent [$pathogen#Virus*] in every season, followed by [@P.xanthii#Virus*].
The highest occurrence of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was in spring 2015; it did not occur in 2016.
The highest occurrence of [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] was in spring 2016; it did not occur in spring 2015.
Myrothecium s.l.
was the most common [$pathogen#Virus*] in fall 2017 and the second most common [$pathogen#Virus*] occurring by itself in fall 2016.
The third most common [$pathogen#Virus*] in fall 2017, [$Corynespora cassiicola#Virus*], was not observed in any other season.
Eight of the 80 isolates of [@Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*]
collected were identified as [$S.caricae#Virus*], the rest as [$S.citrulli#Virus*].
All isolates of [$S.caricae#Virus*] were found in spring 2015 and originated from two fields in different counties.
A total of three positive and five negative associations were found between [$pathogen#Virus*] pairs co-occurring on the same leaf.
A positive association between [@Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*]
and [@C.citrullina#Virus*] was the only significant association between [$pathogens#Virus*] found in two seasons, spring 2015 and spring 2016.
Based on estimates of probability of [$pathogen#Virus*] occurrence across seasons, [@Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*]
and [@P.xanthii#Virus*] are the most common [$pathogens#Virus*] on [$watermelons#Plant*] in South Carolina.
This is the first report of [@C.cassiicola#Virus*], [$S.caricae#Virus*], and [@Myrothecium s.l#Virus*].
on [$watermelon#Plant*] in South Carolina.
