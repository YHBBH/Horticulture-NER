[@Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([$MYSV#Virus*]), a member of the genus [$Tospovirus#Virus*], is a devastating thrips- transmitted virus of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Japan.
Recently, we reported that [$cucumber#Plant*] accessions originating from South Asia, in particular Southeast Asia, had moderate resistance to [$MYSV#Virus*].
Here, we investigated the effect of three temperatures (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C) on symptom expression and viral spread of [$MYSV#Virus*] in plants of resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] accessions.
No systemic infection developed in resistant [$cucumber plants#Plant*] after inoculation with [$melon#Plant*] isolate [$MYSV#Virus*]-S at low temperature (20 degrees C); viral spread of [$MYSV#Virus*]-S and [$cucumber#Plant*] isolate [$MYSV#Virus*]-FuCu05P in inoculated cotyledons was suppressed.
In contrast, higher incubation temperatures (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) facilitated viral spread in inoculated cotyledons and systemic infection of [$MYSV#Virus*]- S.
These data suggest that the resistance to [$MYSV#Virus*] of resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] accessions is temperature dependent.
