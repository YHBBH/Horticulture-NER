Two novel NAC transcription factors from [@C itrullus colocynthis#Plant*] implicated in light and auxin signaling pathway.
   NAC transcription factors (NAM, [@ATAF1, 2#Gene*], [@CUC2#Gene*]) have multiple functions in plant growth and development.
Two NACs, [$CcNAC1#Gene*] and [$CcNAC2#Gene*], were recently identified in the highly drought-tolerant [$cucurbit species#Plant*], [$Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*].
This study examines the functional role of these genes under different qualities of light based on the in silico analysis of the [$CcNAC1#Gene*] and [$CcNAC2#Gene*] promoters that revealed the presence of several light-associated motifs.
The impact of both light and auxin on [$CcNAC1#Gene*] and [$CcNAC2#Gene*] expression was examined in [@C.colocynthis#Plant*] leaves, and using reporter (p[$CcNAC1#Gene*], 2::GUS) lines in [$Arabidopsis#Plant*].
Furthermore, the effects of constitutive overexpression (OE-[$CcNAC1#Gene*], 2) in [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] were also examined under a range of conditions to confirm reporter line linkages.
White, blue, red, and far-red light treatments resulted in similar patterns of quantitative changes in [$CcNAC1#Gene*]and [$CcNAC2#Gene*] expression in both species, with the highest transcript increases following red light.
Photomorphogenic changes in [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] hypocotyls were correlated with gene transcript levels.
In the absence of light, hypocotyls of OE-[$CcNAC1#Gene*]/[$CcNAC2#Gene*] lines were significantly longer as compared to WT.
The addition of exogenous auxin (+IAA) to growth medium also resulted in changes to the hypocotyl lengths of overexpression lines and spatiotemporal reporter line changes in [$seedlings#Plant*].
Our data suggest that [$CcNAC1#Gene*], 2 might be functionally important in the light signaling pathway, and appear connected to the hormone auxin.
This is the first study to indicate that NAC genes might play a role in both light and auxin signaling pathways.
