Anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum orbiculare, induces severe damage to cucurbits worldwide.
Resistance of 112 commercial cultivars of cucurbits to C.
orbiculare was evaluated.
Seedlings of each cultivar at 2- to 3-leaf stage were inoculated with C.
orbiculare KACC 40809 by spraying spore suspension of the fungus at a concentration of 4.0 x 10(5) spores/mL.
Among the 36 cultivars of cucumber, 'Asiastrike', 'Tongilbaedadagi', 'Daeseon', 'Cheongrokmatjjang', 'Nokyacheongcheong', and 'Asianogak' were moderately resistant and the others were susceptible.
All the tested cultivars of melon (33) and watermelon (4) showed highly susceptible response to C.
orbiculare.
On the other hand, the squash cultivars (17) represented less susceptibility to the fungus than the other cucurbits.
Of the squash cultivars, 'Gammirak' and 'Teotbat' were resistant and 12 cultivars were moderately resistant.
Among the rootstocks for cucurbits, ten cultivars including 'JjeuyakaEX', 'Nunbusyeo', 'Union', 'RS111', 'Ganggeuntoza', 'Hwangjaetoza', 'NO.8', 'Shintoza', 'Bulpaetoza', and 'Newtype' shoved high resistance to the anthracnose pathogen.
From the results, the resistant cultivars could be used as sources of resistance to cucurbits anthracnose (C.
orbiculare) in the future breeding programs.
