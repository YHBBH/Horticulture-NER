The present work was conducted to characterize the functionality of 257 [@watermelon EST-SSR primer pairs for their PCR amplification and polymorphisms#Method*].
[@EST-SSR markers #Method*]were tested on DNA sample panels of six [$watermelon#Plant*] cultigens and two related species of [@Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] and [$Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*] based on [@agarose gel electrophoresis and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis#Method*].
Successful [$PCR#Method*]s were shown for 240 primer pairs (79%), and 173 primer pairs (67%) were polymorphic in a [$watermelon#Plant*] DNA sample panel on [@agarose gel electrophoresis#Method*].
In addition, [@HRM analysis of 24 EST-SSR markers#Method*] that were monomorphic on aga[$rose#Plant*] gel separation identified an additional 19 polymorphic markers, indicating that HRM is an efficient tool for the rapid screening of sequence variations and allele discrimination.
In the assessment of genetic relationships, six [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars were closely related together (0.91-0.97) and demonstrated a narrow genetic base in the [$watermelon#Plant*] genetic pool.
A high level of genetic dissimilarity (0.36-0.97) was shown between [$watermelon#Plant*] species and other related species.
Marker transferability to [$melon#Plant*] species ([$Cucumis melo L#Plant*]) was examined by [@cross-species PCR amplification and genetic diversity assessment in eight melon cultigens#Method*].
Of the 257 EST-SSR primer pairs.
79(32.9%) showed successful PCR amplification from [$melon#Plant*] DNA samples.
A dendrogram of the genetic relationship based on 22 [$EST-SSR markers #Method*]showed a clear classification of [$melon#Plant*] genotypes in accordance to fruit characteristics.
The [$EST-SSR markers #Method*]characterized in this study will contribute to diverse genomic investigations and breeding efforts, including comparative genome mapping, marker-assisted selection, and DNA fingerprinting for genetic diversity and cultivar identification in many [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
