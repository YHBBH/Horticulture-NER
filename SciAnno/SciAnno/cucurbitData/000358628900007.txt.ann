Virus infections on [$cucurbits#Plant*] often result in substantial losses.
Surveys were conducted throughout the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in the Republic of South Africa (RSA) during the 2011-2013 growing seasons to identify [$cucurbit-infecting viruses#Virus*].
[$Virus#Virus*]es were detected on sampled leaves displaying virus-like symptoms [@using double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]) and [$reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]).
The phylogenetic relationships of all detected viruses were also studied.
[$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MWMV#Virus*]) and a [$Polerovirus#Virus*] were detected at an incidence of 3.48%, 10%, 13.04%, 48.70% and 41.67% respectively.
[$Phylogenetic analyses#Method*] identified [$CMV#Virus*] isolates as members of the Subgroup IA of the [$CMV#Virus*] lineage and [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates as members of the subgroups AI and All of the of [$ZYMV#Virus*] lineage.
[$MWMV#Virus*] isolates formed a distinct clade within the Southern African group of the [$MWMV#Virus*] lineage.
[$Polerovirus#Virus*] isolates were identified as [@Pepo aphid-borne yellows virus #Virus*]([@PABYV#Virus*]) based on the sequence similarity and [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*].
The information generated from this study will contribute towards the development of effective management strategies against viruses infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in KZN.
