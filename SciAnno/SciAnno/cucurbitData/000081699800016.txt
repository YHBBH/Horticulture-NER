The geographic incidence and molecular variation of three whitefly-borne closteroviruses (lettuce infectious yellows virus [LIYV], cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus [CYSDV], and beet pseudo-yellows virus [BPYV]) were studied in cucurbits collected from several distinct geographic locations.
Of 498 samples analyzed, none were found to be infected by LIYV.
Sixty-nine samples collected in the Middle East and Mediterranean Europe were found infected by CYSDV, and twelve samples from Crete and Italy were infected by BPYV.
Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of a portion of the heat shock protein 70 homolog coding region, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis, was used to estimate the intra- and inter-isolate molecular variability.
These analyses showed that each BPYV and CYSDV isolate was composed of a population of sequence variants with a nucleotide identity greater than 98%.
CYSDV isolates could be divided into two divergent groups.
Group I was only composed of isolates from Spain, Jordan, and Turkey, and group II isolates were predominantly found in Saudi Arabia.
Nucleotide identity between isolates of the same group was greater than 99%, whereas identity between both groups was less than 92%.
All BPYV isolates showed a nucleotide identity greater than 98%.
