[@Gummy stem blight#Disease*] caused by [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] ([$anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum#Virus*]) is a major fungal disease of [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) and other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Thirty-five isolates of [@Didymella#Virus*] and [$Phoma spp#Virus*].
associated with symptoms of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] on [$watermelon#Plant*], [@Canary melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$C.melo#Plant*]), and [$winter squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]) from Florida and Georgia were characterized based on morphology on agar media, [$pathogenicity#Plant*] on 'Melody' [$watermelon#Plant*], [@the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence of ribosomal DNA (rDNA)#Method*], [$random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis#Method*], and [@polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis#Method*].
All of the isolates were [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on [$watermelon#Plant*] but differed in virulence.
[@RAPD and ITS sequence analysis#Method*] indicated genetic variability among the isolates but [$PCR#Method*]-[$RFLP analysis#Method*] did not show any variability.
ITS sequence [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] identified two isolates, [$DB#Virus*]-05 and [$DB#Virus*]-33, which had a greater identity to that of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]isolates from China (98 to 100% sequence homology) than other isolates from Florida and Georgia (95 to 98%).
These two isolates possessed a single nucleotide substitution of A to G at position 131 of the ITS1 region.
The study characterized the genetic profile of a collection of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]isolates from Florida and Georgia in relation to isolates from other U.S.
states and countries.
