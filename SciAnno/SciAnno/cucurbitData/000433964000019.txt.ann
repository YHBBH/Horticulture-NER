[@Cucurbit bacterial wilt#Disease*], caused by [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*], is a devastating disease of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in the Midwest and Northeast U.S.
Current management of [$bacterial wilt#Disease*] relies primarily on insecticide applications to control striped and [$spotted cucumber beetle#Virus*]s ([$Acalymma vittatum#Virus*] and [$Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi#Virus*], respectively), which vector [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*].
Development of alternative management strategies is constrained by a lack of understanding of [$bacterial wilt#Disease*] etiology.
The impact of host age on rate on symptom development and extent of bacterial movement in the xylem of [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo cv.Athena#Plant*]) was evaluated following wound inoculation of 2- to 8-week-old plants in growth chamber experiments.
[$Wilt#Disease*]ing occurred more rapidly in plants after inoculating [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] into 2- or 4-week-old plants than 6- or 8-week-old plants.
Recovery of viable cells from stem segments revealed that vascular spread of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] was more extensive below than above the inoculation point.
These findings provide experimental evidence that host age impacts the rate of symptom development in [$cucurbit bacterial wilt#Disease*] and that movement of the xylem-inhabiting [$pathogen#Virus*] [$E.tracheiphila#Plant*] within [$muskmelon#Plant*] plants occurs primarily in the downward direction.
