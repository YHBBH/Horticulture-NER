[@Watermelon#Plant*] production is often limited by[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] in areas with a large daily temperature range.
Development of resistant [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*] can protect against[$ powdery mildew#Virus*]; however, little is known about the characteristics of its causal agents.
Here, we identified the genus and race of a causal [$pathogen#Virus*] of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] in Ansung province of South Korea, and developed [$molecular markers#Method*] for the generation of resistant [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*].
The causal [$pathogen#Virus*] was determined to be [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]based on multiple sequence alignments of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of rDNA.
The physiological race was identified as 1W, and the Ansung isolate was named P xanthii 1W-AN.
Following inoculation with the identified [@P.xanthii#Virus*] 1W-AN, we found inheritance of the resistant gene fitting a single dominant Mendelian model in a segregated population ('SBA' x PI 254744).
To develop [$molecular markers#Method*] linked to [$fungus#Virus*]-resistant loci, [$random amplified polymorphic DNA#Method*] ([$RAPD#Method*]) was accomplished between DNA pooled from eight near-isogenic lines (NILs; BC4F6), originated from PI 254744 and susceptible 'SBB' [$watermelon#Plant*].
After sequencing bands from [$RAPD#Method*] were identified in all eight NILs and PI254744, 42 sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers were developed.
Overall, 107 F-2 plants derived from BC4F6 NIL-1 X 'SBB' were tested, and one SCAR marker was selected.
Sequence comparison between the SCAR marker and the reference [$watermelon#Plant*] genome identified three Nco I restriction enzyme sites harboring a single nucleotide polymorphism, and codominant cleavage-amplified polymorphic site markers were subsequently developed.
A CAPS marker was converted to a high-resolution melt (HRM) marker, which can discriminate C/T SNP (254PMR-HRM3).
The 254PMR-HRM3 marker was evaluated in 138 F2:3 plants of a segregating population ('SBA' X PI254744) and was presumed to be 4.3 cM from the resistance locus.
These results could ensure P xanthii 1W-AN resistance in [$watermelon#Plant*] germplasm and aid [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivar development in marker-assist breeding programs.
