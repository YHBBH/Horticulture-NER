Grafting of [@watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) is an established production practice that provides resistance to[$ soilborne disease#Disease*]s or tolerance to abiotic stresses.
[$Watermelon#Plant*] may be grafted on several [$cucurbit species #Plant*](interspecific grafting); however, little research exists to describe root systems of these diverse rootstocks.
A greenhouse study was conducted to compare root system morphology of nine commercially available [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks, representing four species: [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]), [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]), and an interspecific hybrid [$squash #Plant*]( [$C.maxima#Plant*] x [$C.moschata#Plant*]).
Rootstocks were grafted with a triploid [$watermelon#Plant*] scion (`Exclamation'), and root systems were compared with nongrafted (NG) and self-grafted (SG) 'Exclamation'.
Plants were harvested destructively at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after transplant (WAT), and data were collected on scion dry weight, total root length (TRL), average root diameter, root surface area, root:shoot dry-weight ratio, root diameter class proportions, and specific root length.
For all response variables, the main effect of rootstock and rootstock species was significant (P < 0.05).
The main effect of harvest was significant (P < 0.05) for all response variables, with the exception of TRL proportion in diameter class 2.
'Ferro' rootstock produced the largest TRL and root surface area, with observed values 122% and 120% greater than the smallest root system ('Exclamation' SG), respectively.
Among rootstock species, [$pumpkin#Plant*] produced the largest TRL and root surface area, with observed values 100% and 82% greater than those of [$watermelon#Plant*], respectively.
These results demonstrate that substantial differences exist during the initial 3 WAT in root system morphology of rootstocks and rootstock species available for [$watermelon#Plant*] grafting and that morphologic differences of root systems can be characterized using image analysis.
