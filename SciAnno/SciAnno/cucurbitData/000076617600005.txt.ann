[@Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria#Virus*] ([@PGPR#Virus*]) strains [@INR7#Virus*] ([@Bacillus pumilus#Virus*]), [@GB03#Virus*] ([@Bacillus subtilis#Virus*]), and [@E1#Virus*]B ([@Curtobacterium flaccumfacies#Virus*]) were tested singly and in combinations for biological control against multiple [$cucumber pathogens#Virus*].
Investigations under greenhouse conditions were conducted with three [@cucumber pathogens#Virus*]-[@Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*] (causing [$anthracnose#Disease*]), [@Pseudomonas syringae pv.lachrymans #Virus*](causing [@angular leaf spot#Disease*]), and [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*] (causing [@cucurbit wilt disease#Disease*])-inoculated singly and in all possible combinations.
There was a general trend across all experiments toward greater suppression and enhanced consistency against multiple [$cucumber pathogens#Virus*] using [@strain mixtures#Method*].
The same three [$PGPR#Virus*] strains were evaluated as seed treatments in two field trials over two seasons, and two strains, IN26 ([@Burkholderia gladioli#Virus*]) and [$INR7#Virus*] also were tested as foliar sprays in one of the trials.
In the field trials, the efficacy of induced systemic resistance activity was determined against introduced [$cucumber pathogens#Virus*] naturally spread within plots through placement of infected plants into the field to provide the pathogen inoculum.
[$PGPR#Virus*]-mediated disease suppression was observed against [$angular leaf spot#Disease*] in 1996 and against a mixed infection of [$angular leaf spot#Disease*] and [$anthracnose#Disease*] in 1997.
The three-way mixture of [@PGPR strains#Virus*] ([$INR7#Virus*] plus [$ME1#Virus*] plus [$GB03#Virus*]) as a seed treatment showed intensive plant growth promotion and disease reduction to a level statistically equivalent to the synthetic elicitor Actigard applied as a spray.
