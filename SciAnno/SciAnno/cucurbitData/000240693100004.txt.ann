[@Cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) is a monoecious plant in which female sex expression (gynoecy) is controlled by the Female (F) locus that can be modified by other sex-determining genes as well as by environmental and hormonal factors.
As in many other [$cucurbits#Plant*], ethylene is the major plant hormone regulating female sex expression.
Previously we isolated the [@Cs-ACS1#Gene*] ([@ACS, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase#Gene*]) gene that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway.
We proposed that [$Cs-ACS1#Gene*] is present in a single copy in monoecious (ffMM) plants whereas gynoecious plants (FFMM) contain an additional copy [@Cs-ACS1G#Gene*] that was mapped to the F locus.
To study the origin of [@Cs-ACS1G#Gene*], we cloned and analyzed both the gynoecious-specific [$Cs-ACS1G gene#Gene*] and the non-sex-specific [$Cs-ACS1#Gene*] gene.
Our results indicate that [$Cs-ACS1G#Gene*] is the result of a relatively recent gene duplication and recombination, between [$Cs-ACS1#Gene*] and a branched-chain amino acid transaminase (BCAT) gene.
Taking into consideration that the [@Cs-ACS1G gene#Gene*] was mapped to the F locus, we propose that this duplication event gave rise to the F locus and to gynoecious [$cucumber#Plant*] plants.
[@Computer analysis#Method*] of the 1 kb region upstream of the transcription initiation site revealed several putative cis-acting regulatory elements that can potentially confer the responsiveness of [$Cs-ACS1G#Gene*] to developmental and hormonal factors and thereby control female sex determination in [$cucumber#Plant*].
These findings lead us to a model explaining the action of [$Cs-ACS1#Gene*] and [$Cs-ACS1G#Gene*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] floral sex determination.
