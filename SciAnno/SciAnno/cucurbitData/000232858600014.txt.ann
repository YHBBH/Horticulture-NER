Twelve and six DNA clones representing various parts of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, respectively, were used to detect polymorphism among five [@watermelon#Plant*] cultivars and 21 U.S.
Plant Introductions (PIs) collected from diverse geographical locations and representing major groups of [@Citrullus species#Plant*].
[@Cluster analysis based on 20 chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and 10 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers#Method*] differentiated the accessions into three major phenetic groups: PIs and [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars of [@Citrullus lanatus subsp.vulgaris#Plant*] ([@Schrad.ex Eckl.et Zeyh.#Plant*]) Fursa (also designated as [@C.lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]) (group I), PIs of [@C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] (of [@C.lanatus subsp.lanatus Schrad.ex Eckl.et Zeyh.#Plant*])(group II), and [@C.colocynthis (L.) Schrad.#Plant*]PIs (group III).
The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars are distinct, but closely related to those of the [$C.lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*] PIs.
On the other hand, the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of the wild species [@C.colocyn#Plant*]this are more similar to those of [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*].
Polymorphic cpDNA and mt[$DNA marker#Method*]s identified in this study can complement isozyme and nuclear DNA data used in earlier phylogenetic and phenetic classifications of [$Citrullus#Plant*] PIs.
These cpDNA and mt[$DNA marker#Method*]s are being used in experiments designed to enhance [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars by replacing the chloroplast and mitochondrial genome of cultivated [$watermelon#Plant*] with those of the wild species [$C.colocyn#Plant*]this.
