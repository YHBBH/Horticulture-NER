[@Southern root-knot nematodes#Disease*] ([$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*]) are an important re-emerging pest of [$watermelon#Plant*] in the United States and worldwide.
The re-emergence of [$root-knot nematodes#Virus*] ([$RKN#Virus*]s) in [$watermelon#Plant*] and other [$cucurbits#Plant*] is largely the result of the intensive cultivation of [$vegetable crops#Plant*] on limited agricultural lands coupled with the loss of methyl bromide for pre-plant soil fumigation, which has been the primary method for control of [$RKN#Virus*]s and many[$ soilborne disease#Disease*]s of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and other [$vegetable crops#Plant*] for several decades.
One alternative for managing [$RKN#Virus*] in [$watermelon#Plant*] is the use of resistant [$rootstocks#Plant*] for grafted [$watermelon#Plant*].
We have developed several [$RKN#Virus*]-resistant [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] var.
citroides lines (designated RKVL for Root-Knot Vegetable Laboratory), which have shown promise as rootstocks for grafted [$watermelon#Plant*].
In 2011 and 2012, we demonstrated that F1 hybrids derived from our selected RKVL lines exhibited resistance to [$RKN#Virus*] that was equal to or greater than that of the parental RKVL lines when grown in fields highly infested with [$M.incognita#Virus*].
In 2011, although significant differences were not observed among [$rootstocks#Plant*], the F1 hybrids produced slightly higher yields compared with the selected parental lines.
Among the selected parental lines, RKVL 318 produced high yields in both years.
In 2011, three of four RKVL parental lines and all four of their F1 hybrids produced greater (P < 0.05) fruit yields than self-grafted `Tri-X 313', 'Emphasis' [$bottle gourd#Plant*], and 'Strong Tosa' [$squash #Plant*]hybrid.
In 2012, three RKVL F1 hybrid lines produced higher yields than the selected parents.
Overall, these F1 hybrids were vigorous and should provide useful genetic material for selection and development of robust [$RKN#Virus*]-resistant [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] rootstock lines.
