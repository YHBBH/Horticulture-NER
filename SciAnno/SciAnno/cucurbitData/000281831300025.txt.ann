[@Melon#Plant*] production in China is threatened by [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] incited by [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*], which can cause severe yield losses.
Disease reactions of 10 [$melon#Plant*] [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race differentials indicated the presence of a unique race of [$P.xanthii#Plant*], denoted pxCh1, in the Shanghai area.
Resistance to [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race pxCh1 in [$melon#Plant*] PI 134198, which originated from India, was controlled by a single, dominant gene, designated Pm-8, in a cross with susceptible [$melon#Plant*] inbred S717.
A search for a molecular marker linked to Pm-8 was initiated using the same cross.
[@Bulk segregant analysis#Method*] of their F-2 progeny revealed one sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) marker of 148 bp linked to Pm-8, at 3.9 cM.
The SRAP segment was recovered, cloned, and sequenced and converted into a sequence-amplified characterized region marker for marker-assisted selection of Pm-8 in breeding programs to develop [$melon cultivars#Plant*] resistant to [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race pxCh1.
