[@Papaya ringspot virus type P#Virus*] ([$PRSV-P#Virus*]) systemically infects [$Carica papaya#Plant*] and species belonging to the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
Attempts to recover [$PRSV-P#Virus*] from naturally infected [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] grown near or among diseased [$papaya#Plant*] [$trees#Plant*] have shown conflicting results worldwide.
This study aimed to evaluate the natural infection of [$cucurbit species #Plant*]grown among and near [$papaya#Plant*] [$trees#Plant*] infected with [$PRSV-P#Virus*] in Brazil.
Natural infection of [$cucurbits#Plant*] with [$PRSV-P#Virus*] occurred in [$zucchini squash#Plant*] but not in [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
However, several attempts to recover [$PRSV-P#Virus*] from numerous[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] cv.
Caserta ([$zucchini squash#Plant*]) plants grown 580m from diseased [$papaya#Plant*] [$trees#Plant*] in the field failed.
Mechanical inoculations of [@Cucurbita pepo cv.Caserta#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima cv.
ExposicAo ([$pumpkin#Plant*]), [@Cucumis sativus cv.Primepack Plus#Plant*] ([$cucumber#Plant*]) and [@Citrullus lanatus cv.#Plant*]
[$Crimson Sweet#Plant*] ([$watermelon#Plant*]) with five Brazilian [$PRSV-P#Virus*] isolates showed that [$zucchini squash#Plant*] was the most susceptible species followed by [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*], while [$pumpkin#Plant*] was not infected.
The results confirmed the variable susceptibility of [$cucurbit species #Plant*]to experimental and natural [$PRSV-P#Virus*] infection.
Given these facts, the control of the disease through roguing should focus mainly on diseased [$papaya#Plant*] plants, as has been practised successfully in Brazil for many years, and on those [$cucurbits#Plant*] particularly known to be susceptible to natural infection with [$PRSV-P#Virus*].
