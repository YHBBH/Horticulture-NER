[@Crown rot#Disease*] caused by [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] is becoming an increasingly important disease of [$vegetable crops#Plant*] in southeastern U.S.
In recent years, the practice of grafting [$watermelon#Plant*] onto rootstocks belonging to other [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] genera has also been slowly gaining adoption in the U.S.
However, it is not known how these rootstocks, developed mainly in Asia, will respond to diseases prevalent in local production areas.
We evaluated the available commercial [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstocks for resistance to [$Phytophthora crown rot#Disease*] by inoculating them with a zoospore suspension of [@P.capsici#Virus*] in four different trials.
Disease development on rootstocks was rated on a 1-9 scale (1 = no symptoms.
9 = plant dead).
Based on all the four trials, the commercial [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] ([$bottle gourd#Plant*]) rootstocks, FR-Strong, Emphasis, Macis and WMXP-3938 were resistant (Mean rating <= 3) to [$crown rot#Disease*] when compared to susceptible [$watermelon#Plant*] checks (mean rating >8).
All[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] inter-specific hybrid rootstocks and a [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstock Ojakkyo, were highly susceptible to [$crown rot#Disease*] (mean rating >8).
[@Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using two different P.capsici specific primers (ITS and p-tubulin)#Method*] indicated the presence of significantly (P < 0.0001) greater amounts of [@P.capsici#Virus*] DNA g(-1) plant tissue in susceptible[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] inter-specific hybrid rootstocks (beta-tubulin, mean = 2895 ng) and [$watermelon#Plant*] (2665 ng) compared to the L siceraria rootstocks (357 ng).
[$Crown rot#Disease*] resistant [$bottle gourd#Plant*] [$rootstocks#Plant*] may be useful in areas where [@P.capsici#Virus*] is a recurring problem.
The present study identified several commercial [$bottle gourd#Plant*] [$rootstocks#Plant*] with resistance to [$Phytophthora crown rot#Disease*], and confirmed their levels of resistance using q[$PCR#Method*].
