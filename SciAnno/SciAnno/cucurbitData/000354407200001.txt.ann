The [@papaya ring spot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) causes significant fruit yield loss in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
Understanding of the inheritance and molecular mapping of [$PRSV#Virus*] resistance will facilitate development of resistant varieties to control this disease.
In the present study, an F-2 population was developed from the cross between susceptible '65G' and resistant '02245' [$cucumber#Plant*] inbred lines.
[$Genetic analysis#Method*] of [$PRSV#Virus*] resistance in 144 F-2:3-derived F-3 families showed that resistance is controlled by a single recessive gene which was designated as prsv(02245).
[@Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers#Method*] were employed in polymorphism screening between [$PRSV#Virus*]-susceptible and resistant DNA pools.
The [$PRSV#Virus*] resistance gene, prsv(02245), was mapped on chromosome 6 that was flanked by two [$SSR markers#Method*], SSR11-177 and SSR11-1, which was 1.1 and 2.9 cM away from the prsv(02245) locus, respectively.
The physical distance between the two markers was approximately 600 kb.
The accuracy rate of marker-assisted selection of [$PRSV#Virus*] resistance among 35 [$cucumber#Plant*] lines using the marker, SSR11-177 was more than 80 %.
Results from this study provide a valuable tool for fine mapping, gene cloning, and marker-assisted breeding for [$PRSV#Virus*] resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*].
