[@ Luteoviruses#Virus*] were recognized as a plant virus group by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ITCV) in 1975.
They have a number of biological properties in common such as their isometric particles, their restriction to phloem tissue and their dependence on aphid vectors for transmission.
They were initially separated into 2 distinct subgroups on the basis of their serological relatedness and cytopathological effects.
During the last few years, complete genome sequences and organisations have been determined for many [@luteoviruses#Virus*] and, depending on the region of the genome, various relationships are observed between [$luteoviruses#Virus*] and other plant viruses.
More sequence homologies are observed between [$luteoviruses#Virus*], for the 3' half of their genome coding for the structural proteins (capsid, readthrough) and the putative movement protein (figs 1 and 2a).
[$Luteovirus#Virus*]es differ mainly in the evolutionary origin of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) encoded by the 5' half of the genome (figs I and 2b).
Thus, the RdRp of the subgroup I [$luteoviruses#Virus*] (PAV and MAV serotypes of the [@barley yellow dwarf virus#Virus*] ([@BYDV#Virus*]) and the [$soybean#Plant*] dwarf virus) show many similarities with those of the dianthoviruses, carmoviruses and tombusviruses (fig 2b).
In contrast, subgroup 2 [$luteoviruses#Virus*] ([@potato leafroll virus#Virus*], [@beet western yellow virus#Virus*] ([$BWYV#Virus*]), [@cucurbit aphid borne virus#Virus*] and the [@BYDV-RPV#Virus*]), have a sobemo-like polymerase (fig 2b).
This dichotomy in sequence homology between the 5' and the 3' halves of their genome suggests an important role of RNA recombination in the evolution of [$luteoviruses#Virus*].
Mixed infections occur between [$luteoviruses#Virus*] and other plant viruses and are favourable situations for the generation of new virus entities.
The newly generated viruses may have genomes composed of 2 taxonomically different RNA molecules, such as the ST9 strain of the [$BWYV#Virus*] or the [$pea#Plant*] enation mosaic enamovirus.
They may also have genomes generated by RNA recombination.
Subgroup 1 [$luteoviruses#Virus*] may have been generated by a RNA recombination event between a subgroup 2 [$luteovirus#Virus*] and a dianthovirus (fig 1).
Additional RNA recombination events that occurred during [$luteovirus#Virus*] evolution could be deduced from sequence comparison of strains of the same [$luteovirus#Virus*] or different [$luteoviruses#Virus*].
