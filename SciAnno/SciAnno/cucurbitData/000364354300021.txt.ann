[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) is an economically important [$pathogen#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] that is transmitted both horizontally and vertically.
Although [$ZYMV#Virus*] is seed-transmitted in[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]pepo, the potential for seed transmission in virus-resistant transgenic cultivars is not known.
We crossed and backcrossed a transgenic [$squash #Plant*]cultivar with wild [$C.pepo#Plant*], and determined whether seed-to-seedling transmission of [$ZYMV#Virus*] was possible in seeds harvested from transgenic backcrossed [$C.pepo#Plant*].
We then compared these transmission rates to those of non-transgenic (backcrossed and wild) [$C.pepo#Plant*].
The overall seed-to-seedling transmission rate in [$ZYMV#Virus*] was similar to those found in previous studies (1.37%), with no significant difference between transgenic backcrossed (2.48%) and non-transgenic (1.03%) backcrossed and wild [$squash#Plant*].
Fewer transgenic backcrossed plants had symptom development (7%) in comparison with all non-[$transgenic plants#Plant*] (26%) and may be instrumental in preventing yield reduction due to [$ZYMV#Virus*].
Our study shows that [$ZYMV#Virus*] is seed transmitted in transgenic backcrossed [$squash#Plant*], which may affect the spread of [$ZYMV#Virus*] via the movement of [$ZYMV#Virus*]-[$infe#Virus*]cted seeds.
Deep genome sequencing of the seed-transmitted viral populations revealed that 23% of the variants found in this study were present in other vertically transmitted [$ZYMV#Virus*] populations, suggesting that these variants may be necessary for seed transmission or are distributed geographically via seeds.
