Three aphid-transmitted viruses belonging to the [@Polerovirus genus#Virus*], [@Beet mild yellowing virus#Virus*] ([@BMYV#Virus*]), [@Beet chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([@BChV#Virus*]), and [@Beet western yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BWYV#Virus*]), have been described as [$pathogens#Virus*] of [$sugar beet#Plant*].
We present the complete biological, serological, and molecular characterization of an American isolate of [$Beet western yellows virus#Virus*] ([@BWYV-USA#Virus*]), collected from yellow [$beet#Plant*] leaves.
The biological data suggested that [$BWYV-USA#Virus*] displayed a host range similar to that of [$BMYV#Virus*], but distinct from those of [$BChV#Virus*] and the [$lettuce#Plant*] and rape isolates of [@Turnip yellows virus#Virus*].
The complete genomic RNA sequence of [$BWYV-USA#Virus*] showed a genetic organization and expression typical of other [$Polerovirus#Virus*] members.
Comparisons of deduced amino acid sequences showed that PO and the putative replicase complex (P1-P2) of [$BWYV-USA#Virus*] are more closely related to [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) than to [$BMYV#Virus*], whereas alignments of P3, P4, and P5 showed the highest homology with [$BMYV#Virus*].
Intraspecific and interspecific [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*] have suggested that the [$BWYV-USA#Virus*] genome may be the result of recombination events between a [$CABYV#Virus*]-Iike ancestor contributing open reading frame (ORF) 0, ORF 1, and ORF 2, and a [$beet#Plant*] [$Polerovirus#Virus*] progenitor providing the 3' ORFs, with a similar mechanism of speciation occurring for [$BMYV#Virus*] in Europe.
Results demonstrate that [$BWYV-USA#Virus*] is a distinct species in the [$Polerovirus genus#Virus*], clarifying the nomenclature of this important group of viruses.
