Due to limited availability of arable land and high market demand for off-season [@vegetables#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*] (plants in the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*]) are continuously cultivated under unfavorable conditions in some countries.
These conditions include environments that are too cold, wet, or dry, or are cool low-light winter greenhouses.
Successive cropping can increase salinity, the incidence of [$cucurbit#Plant*] pests, and [@soilborne diseases#Disease*] like fusarium wilt caused by [$Fusarium spp#Virus*].
These conditions cause various physiological and pathological disorders leading to severe [$crop#Plant*] loss.
Chemical pest control is expensive, not always effective, and can harm the environment.
Grafting can overcome many of these problems.
In fact, in many parts of the world, grafting is a routine technique in continuous cropping systems.
It was first commonly used in Japan during the late 1920s by grafting [$watermelon#Plant*] [[@Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.and Nakai#Plant*]] onto [$pumpkin#Plant*] [[@Cucurbita moschata Duchesne ex.Poir#Plant*]] rootstocks.
Soon after, [$watermelons#Plant*] were grafted onto [$bottle gourd#Plant*] [[@Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standl.#Plant*]] rootstocks.
This practice helped control declining yield due to [$soilborne diseases#Disease*].
China produces more than half the world's [$watermelons#Plant*] and [$cucumbers#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]), and approximately 20% of these are grafted.
Use of rootstocks can enhance plant vigor through vigorous attainment of soil nutrients, avoidance of soil [$pathogens#Virus*] and tolerance of low soil temperatures, salinity, and wet-soil conditions.
The type of rootstock affects [$cucurbit#Plant*] plant growth, yield, and fruit quality.
[$Cucurbit#Plant*] grafting is rare in the United States, but with continued loss of quality disease-free farmland along with the phase-out of methyl bromide, the U.S.
[$cucurbit#Plant*] industry sees grafting as an attractive option.
Some seed companies now offer [$watermelon#Plant*] transplants grafted onto [$squash #Plant*]or [$bottle gourd#Plant*] rootstocks, and some transplant facilities offer grafting services.
There have been thorough analyses of [$cucurbit#Plant*] grafting in other countries, but the literature in English is limited.
This review summarizes the state of the [$cucurbit#Plant*] grafting industry on a global level, translating work published in many languages.
