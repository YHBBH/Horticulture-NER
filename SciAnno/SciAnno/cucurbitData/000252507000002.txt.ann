Green and yellow snap [@bean plants#Plant*] with water-soaked foliar le[$sions#Plant*], stem necrosis, pod blight, and overall plant decline were observed in four commercial fields in three Michigan counties during 2003 to 2005.
All fields were cropped to [$cucurbits#Plant*] that exhibited symptoms of [$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] infection in recent years.
In all, 680 isolates of [$P.capsici#Virus*] were obtained from [$bean#Plant*] steins, petioles, leaves, and pods; the [$pathogen#Virus*] was not recovered from roots.
Koch's postulates were completed with representative isolates, confirming [$P capsici#Virus*] as the causal organism.
Select isolates also were [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on [$cucumber#Plant*] fruit, causing symptoms consistent with [@P.capsici#Virus*] infection.
The majority of the [$P.capsici#Virus*] isolates collected were sensitive to the [$fungicide#Method*] mefenoxam and were of the A1 mating type.
Under laboratory conditions, six [$P.capsici#Virus*] isolates from snap [$bean#Plant*] (2003) were [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on 12 different commercial [$bean#Plant*] cultivars, including [$soybean#Plant*].
Infected [$bean plants#Plant*] exhibited water-soaked lesions, foliar necrosis, and wilting.
We subjected 13 1 isolates collected from 2003 and 2004 to amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis to investigate diversity among isolates and geographical populations and to determine whether [$bean#Plant*] [$P.capsici#Virus*] isolates were similar to isolates from a [$cucurbit#Plant*] host.
This is the first in-depth study of [$P capsici#Virus*] on snap [$bean#Plant*] in Michigan.
Although [$bean#Plant*] cultivars previously were considered a suitable rotation for [$crops#Plant*] susceptible to [$P capsici#Virus*], this is no longer a recommended practice.
