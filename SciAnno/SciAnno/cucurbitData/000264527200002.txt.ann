In 2002, a [@powdery mildew#Virus*] with catenate [$conidia#Virus*] lacking fib[$rosin#Plant*] bodies was found on [@cucumber#Plant*] in a greenhouse in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.
[@Morphological observation#Method*] revealed that the [$fungus#Virus*] belongs to [@Oidium subgenus Reticuloidium#Virus*], anamorph of the [@genus Golovinomyces#Virus*].
[@Molecular phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of the nucleotide sequences of the rDNA ITS regions and D1/D2 domains of the 28S rDNA indicated that the [$fungus#Virus*] belongs to the clade of [@G.orontii#Virus*] with other [@Golovinomyces fungi#Virus*] from a wide range of [$host plants#Plant*], suggesting that the [$fungus#Virus*] was newly transported from abroad.
Because there has been no prior report of [@cucumber powdery mildew#Disease*] caused by [@Reticuloidium#Virus*], further research on the physiology, [$epidemiology#Method*], control and resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] varieties is required.
