Importance and genetic diversity of vegetable-infecting tospoviruses in India.
Phytopathology 101:367-376.
   A survey for [@Peanut bud necrosis virus#Virus*] ([@PBNV#Virus*]), [@Watermelon bud necrosis virus#Virus*] ([@WBNV#Virus*]), [@Capsicum chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([@CaCV#Virus*]), and [@his yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([@IYSV#Virus*]) was conducted between 2002 and 2009 in the major [$vegetable#Plant*]-growing areas in India.
[$PBNV#Virus*] was documented widely in [$tomato#Plant*] and [@chili peppers#Plant*] in 14 states representing southern, northwestern, north-eastern, and central regions and [$WBNV#Virus*] was predominantly detected in [$watermelons#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] in all except north-eastern regions.
In addition, the expanded host range of [$PBNV#Virus*] to [$watermelons#Plant*] and other [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$WBNV#Virus*] to [$tomato#Plant*] and [$chili peppers#Plant*] was observed leading to natural mixed infection of the two viruses.
[$IYSV#Virus*] was found in [$onion#Plant*] in southern, central, and north-eastern regions and [$CaCV#Virus*] in [$tomato#Plant*] and [$chili peppers#Plant*] in northern and southern regions, respectively.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of the nucleocapsid gene revealed segregation of field isolates of [$PBNV#Virus*] and [$WBNV#Virus*] into two distinct subclades, whereas isolates of [$CaCV#Virus*] and [$IYSV#Virus*] each clustered into a single elude.
A proposal for establishing [$WBNV#Virus*] as a distinct [$tospovirus#Virus*] species is made based on the molecular characterization of small-(S) and medium-(M) RNA segments.
