A [@reliable and species-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay#Method*] was developed for detection of the complex soilborne anamorphic [$fungus#Virus*] [$Fusarium oxysporum#Virus*].
The new primer pair, designed on the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene with an amplicon of 142 bp, was highly specific to [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]without cross reactions with other [$Fusarium spp#Virus*].
The protocol was applied to grafted [$melon plants#Plant*] for the detection and quantification of [@F.oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*], a devastating [$pathogen#Virus*] of this [$cucurbit#Plant*].
[@Grafting technologies#Method*] are widely used in [$melon#Plant*] to confer resistance against new virulent races of [@Foxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*], while maintaining the properties of valuable commercial varieties.
However, the effects on the vascular [$pathogen#Virus*] colonization have not been fully investigated.
Analyses were performed on 'Charentais-T' (susceptible) and 'Nad-1' (resistant) [$melon cultivars#Plant*], both used either as rootstock and scion, and inoculated with [@E oxysporum f.sp.melonis race 1 and race 1,2#Virus*].
Pathogen development was compared [$using qPCR#Method*] and isolations from stem tissues.
Early asymptomatic [$melon#Plant*] infections were detected with a quantification limit of 1 pg of fungal DNA.
The q[$PCR#Method*] protocol clearly showed that fungal development was highly affected by host [$pathogen#Virus*] interaction (compatible or incompatible) and time (days postinoculation).
The principal significant effect (P <= 0.01) on fungal development was due to the [$melon#Plant*] genotype used as rootstock, and this effect had a significant interaction with time and [@F oxysporum f.sp.melonis race#Virus*].
In particular, the amount of race 1,2 DNA was significantly higher compared with that estimated for race 1 in the incompatible interaction at 18 days postinoculation.
The two fungal races were always present in both the rootstock and scion of grafted plants in either the compatible or incompatible interaction.
