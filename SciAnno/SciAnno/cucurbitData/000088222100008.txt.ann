Nine accessions of three [@cucurbit#Plant*] species, ten of eight [@legume#Plant*] species, three of [$lettuce#Plant*] ([$Lactuca sativa#Plant*]) and 34 of 14 [@Solanaceae #Plant*]species were inoculated with a Dutch isolate of the [@tomato powdery mildew fungus #Virus*]([@Oidium lycopersici#Virus*]) to determine its host range.
Macroscopically, no fungal growth was visible on [@sweet pepper#Plant*] ([@Capsicum annuum#Plant*]), [$lettuce#Plant*], [@petunia#Plant*] ([@Petunia spp.#Plant*]) and most [$legume#Plant*] species ([@Lupinus albus#Plant*], [@L.luteus#Plant*], [@L.mutabilis#Plant*], [@Phaseolus vulgaris#Plant*], [@Vicia faba#Plant*], [@Vigna radiata#Plant*], [@V.unguiculata#Plant*]).
Trace infection was occasionally observed on [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), [@courgette#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), [@pea#Plant*] ([@Pisum sativum#Plant*]) and [@Solanum dulcamara#Plant*].
[@Eggplant#Plant*] ([@Solanum melongena#Plant*]), the cultivated [$potato#Plant*] ([@Solanum tuberosum#Plant*]) and three wild [$potato#Plant*] species ([@Solanum albicans#Plant*], [@S.acaule#Plant*] and [@S.mochiquense#Plant*]) were more heavily infected in comparison with [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$courgette#Plant*], [$pea#Plant*] and [@S.dulcamara#Plant*], but the fungus could not be maintained on these hosts.
All seven [$tobacco#Plant*] ([$Nicotiana tabacum#Plant*]) accessions were as susceptible to [@O.lycopersici#Virus*] as [$tomato#Plant*] ([@Lycopersicon esculentum cv Moneymaker#Plant*]), suggesting that [$tobacco#Plant*] is an alternative host.
This host range of the [$tomato#Plant*] [$powdery mildew#Disease*] differs from that reported in some other countries, which also varied among each other, suggesting that the causal agent of [$tomato#Plant*] [$powdery mildew#Disease*] in the Netherlands differ from that in those countries.
Histological observations on 36 accessions showed that the defense to [$O.lycopersici#Virus*] was associated with a posthaustorial hypersensitive response.
