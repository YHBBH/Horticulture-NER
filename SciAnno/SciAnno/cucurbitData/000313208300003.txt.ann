We developed a [@real-time PCR assay using a TaqMan probe (TM-qPCR) for specific detection and quantification#Method*] of [$Phomopsis sclerotioides#Virus*], causal agent of [$black root rot#Disease*] of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
The design of the primer sets and hybridization probe was based on the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA.
The [@TM-qPCR assay#Method*] was compared with a conventional, [@standard PCR (sPCR) assay#Method*] and on a [@quantitative real-time PCR (SG-qPCR) assay#Method*] based on SYBR Green I.
The [$TM-qPCR assay#Method*] had a detection limit of ca.
0.4 fg of [@P.sclerotioides#Virus*] DNA, which was approximately 100 times more sensitive than the [@sPCR assay#Method*] and almost equivalent to the [@SG-qPCR assay#Method*].
The [@TM-qPCR#Method*] and [$SG-qPCR assay#Method*]s both were able to detect various quantities of [$P.sclerotioides#Virus*] DNA from diseased plants and infested soils, including DNA levels that were not detectable by the [$sPCR assay#Method*].
However, the [$TM-qPCR#Method*] was advantageous for samples containing [$PCR#Method*]-inhibiting substances because its [$multiplex real-time PCR#Method*] function allows the adjustment of cycle threshold values with an internal control.
Based on the high specificity and sensitivity required for analyzing DNA in natural samples, the newly developed [$TM-qPCR assay#Method*] was the most reliable tool for rapidly detecting and quantifying [$P.sclerotioides#Virus*] in plant and soil samples.
