[@Powdery mildew#Disease*] caused by [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]is an important disease of [$melon#Plant*], and race 2F is the predominant race in most areas of China.
Resistance to [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race 2F in [$melon#Plant*] K7-1 was controlled by a dominant gene, designated Pm-2F, in a 106-member population of recombinant inbred lines derived from K7-1x susceptible K7-2.
Using [@bulked segregant analysis with molecular markers#Method*], we have identified two polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) to determine that Pm-2F is located on linkage group II.
[@Comparative genomic analyses using mapped SSR markers and the cucumber genome sequence#Method*] showed that the [$melon#Plant*] chromosomal region carrying Pm-2F is homologous to a 288,223 bp genomic region on [$cucumber#Plant*] chromosome (chr) 1.
The [$SSR markers#Method*] on chr 1 of [$cucumber#Plant*], SSR02734, SSR02733 and CS27 were found linked with Pm-2F.
[@Comparative mapping#Method*] showed that two [$SSR markers#Method*] (SSR02734 and CMBR8) flanked the Pm-2F locus and two nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich re[$pea#Plant*]t resistance genes were identified in the collinear region of [$cucumber#Plant*].
A [@cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker#Method*] was developed from the sequence of resistance genes and it delimits the genomic region carrying Pm-2F to 0.8 cM.
The evaluation of 165 [$melon#Plant*] accessions and 13 race differential lines showed that the newly developed CAPS (CAPS-Dde I) marker can be used as a universal marker for effective marker assisted selection in [$melon#Plant*][$ powdery mildew#Virus*] resistance breeding.
The putative resistance gene cluster provides a potential target site for further fine mapping and cloning of Pm-2F.
