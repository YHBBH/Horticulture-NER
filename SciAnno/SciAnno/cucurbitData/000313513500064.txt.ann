Application of fungicides is still the principal method for managing harmfulness of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], a causal agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], which is one of the most important diseases on [$cucumber#Plant*].
There are non-systemic (contact) fungicides as well as systemic fungicides (single-site inhibitors).
The latter ones are more efficient but, unfortunately, their repeated application highly increases a risk of development of resistant [$pathogen#Virus*] strains.
Therefore, effective chemical control strategies rely mostly upon weekly applications of contact fungicides.
Totally 63 isolates of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]collected in 8 regions of the Czech Republic (25 in 2005, 18 in 2006 and 20 in 2007) were assessed for a degree of their resistance to fungicides.
Six fungicide agents were chosen for testing their effectiveness, using five concentrations, in a floating disc bioassay.
The active ingredient of two fungicide agents used was metalaxyl.
As one of these agents has been so far the most widely used against [$downy mildew#Virus*] on [$cucumber#Plant*] in the Czech Republic in the past few years, it enabled us to monitor the distribution and development of resistant strains in Czech [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations.
Significant differences in effectiveness among fungicides were observed.
Metalaxyl, metalaxyl-M, cymoxanil and dimethomorph were found ineffective; nearly all [$pathogen#Virus*] isolates expressed a resistant reaction to the recommended concentration of these fungicides.
In contrast, propamocarb and fosetyl-Al were found effective at the recommended concentrations.
Nevertheless, a few strains resistant or tolerant to propamocarb were observed in 2005 and 2006, indicating that selection for resistance strains is in progress in the Czech [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations, and thus more screening is necessary.
The results indicate that generally, the effectiveness of the studied fungicides against [$P.cubensis #Virus*]has progressively declined.
