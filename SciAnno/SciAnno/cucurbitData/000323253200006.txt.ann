[@Potato#Plant*] ([$Solanum tuberosum#Plant*]) is one of the important [$vegetable crops#Plant*] in the world and its production is seriously affected by [@apical leaf curl disease #Disease*]in northern India.
This paper reveals the role of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in maintaining [$Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus#Virus*] ([$ToLCNDV#Virus*]) and [@Potato apical leaf curl#Virus*] ([@PALCD#Virus*]) disease in that region.
The affected plants showed severe leaf curling and stunted growth.
The [$begomovirus#Virus*] causing [@leaf curling and mosaic disease#Disease*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*] could be easily transmitted by the [$whitefly#Virus*] to [$potato#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] and develop [$apical leaf curl disease #Disease*]in northern India.
The movement of the virus by [$whiteflies#Virus*] from [$cucurbits#Plant*] to [$potato#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] is possible because of overlapping of planting and harvesting dates of these [$crops#Plant*].
The causal virus was identified as a [$begomovirus#Virus*] on the basis of [$whitefly#Virus*] transmission, [$PCR#Method*], [@dot blot hybridization, cloning and sequencing#Method*] of the [$coat protein gene#Gene*].
The comparison of full length [$coat protein gene#Gene*] sequence homology revealed that 90% identity with the [$coat protein gene#Gene*] of [@ToLCNDV- [Luffa]#Virus*] isolate and the [$phylogenetic tree#Method*] derived from these sequences with other selected [$begomoviruses#Virus*] formed a close cluster with [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] isolates.
The findings proved that the virus causing disease in [$cucurbits#Plant*] could easily move to [$tomato#Plant*] and [$potato#Plant*] and cause leaf curl disease naturally.
This is the first observation on the role of [$sponge gourd#Plant*] for maintenance of [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] and serving as a host for [$PALCD#Virus*] in northern India.
The findings indicate that the causal organism is a strain of [$ToLCNDV#Virus*].
