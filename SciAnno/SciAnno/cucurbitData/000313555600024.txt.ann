[@Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) is a major limiting factor for large-scale planting of [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Based on the difference of host range, most strains of [$PRSV#Virus*] belong to type P ([$PRSV P#Virus*], [$papaya#Plant*] infecting) devastating on [$papaya#Plant*] in tropical areas or type W ([$PRSV W#Virus*], non-[$papaya#Plant*]-infecting) causing severe loss on [$cucurbits#Plant*] worldwide.
Viruses of [$PRSV P#Virus*] infect plants of the [@families Chenopodiaceae#Plant*], [$Cucuribitaceae#Plant*] and [@Caricaceae#Plant*] ([$papaya family#Plant*]), whereas, viruses of [$PRSV W#Virus*] only infect plants of [$Chenopodiaceae#Plant*] and [$Cucuribitaceae#Plant*].
[$Phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of [$PRSV#Virus*] isolates revealed that the divergence of [$PRSV#Virus*] is correlated to geographic distribution and not to the biological difference in host reactions, suggesting that P type viruses may derive from W type viruses.
To study the genetic determinant(s) of [$PRSV#Virus*] for [$papaya#Plant*] infection, infectious cDNA clones of type P and type W viruses, driven by a bacteriophage promoter to express in vitro infectious transcript or by [$Cauliflower mosaic virus#Virus*] 35S promoter to express in vivo infectious transcript, were generated in our laboratory and used for recombination analyses.
The bioassay of recombinant viruses revealed that the nt 6500-7000 of [$PRSV P#Virus*] genome is responsible for [$papaya#Plant*] infection.
Sequence comparison showed that amino acid positions at 176 of NIaVPg, and 27 and 205 of NIaPro are significantly different among type P and type W viruses.
Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Lys(27) of NIaPro determines host specificity of [$PRSV#Virus*] for infection of [$papaya#Plant*].
Our results indicate that the host range of [$PRSV#Virus*] can be switched just by a single amino acid mutation.
Thus, we have shown experimental evidence that [$PRSV#Virus*] type P may easily evolve from type W and explained the reason why type P and W viruses are closer to each other in the same geographic zone.
Furthermore, the potential risk for planting [$papaya#Plant*] adjacent to [$cucurbit #Plant*]fields is also discussed.
