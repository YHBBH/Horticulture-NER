AB A virus was isolated from [$squirting cucumber#Plant*] ([@Ecballium elaterium L.#Plant*]) collected in France (Alpes de Haute Provence).
After [$mechanical inoculation#Method*], eight species belonging to the[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae were found susceptible to this virus with systemic symptoms of mosaic, chlorotic spots, and fruit deformations.
The French [$ZYFV#Virus*] ([@ZYFV-Fr#Virus*]) isolate differed from the type strain in its ability to infect some differential [$host plants#Plant*].
Elongated flexuous particles with a modal length of 752 nm were observed by electron microscopy in leaf extracts.
Cytoplasmic inclusions similar to those associated with infections by members of the [$potyvirus#Virus*] group were observed by light microscopy.
The virus was found by [@SDS-immunodiffusion and DAS-ELISA#Method*] to be serologically related but distinct from the type strain of [$zucchini yellow fleck virus#Virus*] from Italy ([$ZYFV#Virus*]-It).
[$ZYFV#Virus*] has not yet been found in cultivated [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] in France; this virus appears to be restricted to [$squirting cucumber#Plant*]s in a few localities.
The distribution of [$ZYFV#Virus*] in France is discussed.
