Eighteen [@cucurbit#Plant*] cultivars representing five genera, nine species, and 17 horticultural types were inoculated with [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] in field plots in Charleston, SC, in autumn 2008, autumn 2009, and spring 2011 to determine susceptibility to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*].
In each year, [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] cankers occurred more frequently on crowns or main stems of 'Athena' [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and 'Green Striped Cushaw' [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita argyrosperma#Plant*]) than on all other cultivars except 'Rocio' [$honeydew#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) in 2009, and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) and [@Ojakkyo citron#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*]) in 2011.
[$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] was highly resistant to stem cankers.
Severity of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] on foliage was moderate to severe in autumn 2009, mild to severe in autumn 2008, and very mild in spring 2011 (due to unusually dry weather).
[$Watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]) and [$melon#Plant*] were the most susceptible to foliar blight in 2008 and 2009.
In all 3 years, 'Cheese' and 'Bugle' [$squash #Plant*](both [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]), and 'Judgment III' and 'Lioness'[$ summer squash#Plant*] ([$C.pepo#Plant*]) were among the cultivars with the least diseased leaf area.[$C.moschata#Plant*], [$C.pepo#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*], and [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] ([@smooth loofah#Plant*]) were significantly less susceptible to foliar blight than [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and three [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] cultivars in 2008 and 2009.
This study also is the first documentation of susceptibility of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] argyrosperma to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*].
