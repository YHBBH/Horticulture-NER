Whitefly-transmitted [@Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit leaf crumple virus#Virus*] ([$CuLCrV#Virus*]) and [$aphid#Virus*]-transmitted [$Papaya ringspot virus type W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) have had serious impact on [$watermelon#Plant*] production in southwest and west-central Florida in the past 5 years.
Tissue-blot nucleic acid hybridization assays were developed for simple, high-throughput detection of these three viruses as well as [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]).
which was first reported in Florida in 2008.
To determine virus distribution within plants, we collected 80 entire plants just before or during the harvest period in a systematic sample, 20 each on 11 April, 18 April, 26 April, and 3 May 2007, from a fruiting commercial [$watermelon#Plant*] field near Immokalee.
FL showing symptoms of infection by [$SqVYV#Virus*], [$CuLCrV#Virus*], and [$PRSV-W#Virus*] and, possibly, [$CYSDV#Virus*].
This was followed by a sampling of five plants collected at harvest showing symptoms of virus infection on II October 2007 in a different commercial planting located in Duette, FL.
Tissue prints were made from cross sections of [$watermelon#Plant*] plants from the crowns through the tips at 0.6-m intervals on nylon membranes and nucleic acid hybridization assays were used for virus detection.
Results from testing crown tissue showed that [$SqVYV#Virus*].
[$CuLCrV#Virus*], and [$PRSV-W#Virus*] were present in approximate to 37, 44, and 54%, respectively, of the 80 plants collected over the four sampling dates from the first field.
For individual vines diagnosed with [$SqVYV#Virus*], the distribution of [$SqVYV#Virus*] in vine tissue decreased proportionately with distance from the crown.
The probability of detecting [$SqVYV#Virus*] was 70% at the base of the vine compared with 23% at the tip of the vine.
In contrast, [$CuLCrV#Virus*] tended to be more evenly distributed throughout the plant, with approximate to 10% higher probability of detection at the growing tip relative to the crown of the plant.
The distribution of [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resembled that of [$SqVYV#Virus*] but with approximate to 20% higher probability of detection at the tip of the vine.
Similar trends were detected in the smaller sampling: however, [$CYSDV#Virus*] was also detected in three of the plants.
Overall, the results indicated that [$SqVYV#Virus*] and [$PRSV-W#Virus*] were distributed differently than [$CuLCrV#Virus*] in [$watermelon#Plant*] plants, and this difference has implications on how samples should be collected and may affect vector acquisition and transmission of these viruses.
