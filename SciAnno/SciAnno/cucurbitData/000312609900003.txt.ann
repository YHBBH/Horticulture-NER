The influence of the location of [@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] in [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds on the efficiency of [$pathogen#Virus*] extraction and detection was investigated using seed lots generated by inoculating [$watermelon#Plant*] stigmas (pistil inoculation) or ovary pericarps (pericarp inoculation) with [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strain AAC00-1.
Pistil inoculation results primarily in bacterial localisation in the seed embryo, whereas pericarp inoculation results in bacterial deposition under the seed coat.
[$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] was extracted from [$watermelon#Plant*] seed samples (120 seeds per lot and inoculation method) by maceration or washing with phosphate-buffered saline.
Total genomic DNA was purified from samples after the application of each extraction technique, and subjected to [@quantitative real-time PCR with A.citrulli-specific primers#Method*].
To confirm [$PCR#Method*] results, bacterial isolations were attempted from seed macerates and seed washes onto a semi-selective medium.
Seed washing facilitated detection of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]from 80.0 and 82.5% of pericarp-inoculated seed lots by [$PCR#Method*] and plating, respectively, as compared with 12.0 and 14.0% for pistil-inoculated seed lots.
In contrast, maceration facilitated the detection of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]from >= 94% of the seed samples, regardless of inoculation method.
Based on a seedling grow-out assay, 100% of the seed lots transmitted [$BFB#Disease*] to resulting [$seedlings#Plant*].
Additionally, [$A.citrulli #Virus*]populations from pericarp- and pistil-inoculated seed lots were enumerated to determine bacterial recovery from seed washes and seed macerates by [$real-time PCR#Method*] and [@plating on semi-selective agar plates#Method*].
The frequency distribution of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]populations (log(10) CFU g(-1)) in seed wash vs.
seed macerate was not significantly different for pericarp-inoculated lots (P = 0.070).
However, for pistil-inoculated lots, the difference between frequency distributions was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
These results indicate that the ability to extract [$A.citrulli #Virus*]from [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds was influenced by the location of the [$pathogen#Virus*].
Irrespective of [$pathogen#Virus*] location, maceration was more effective than washing for extracting [$A.citrulli #Virus*]from infected [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds.
