Abiotic and biotic stresses both decrease quality and quantity of cultivated plants.
We compared responses of [@Cucumis sativus L.cvs Sardes#Plant*] and Beith alpha which were treated with 50 or 100 mM NaCl and/or infected by [@Pseudoperospora cubensis Berk#Virus*].
and Curt.Rostov..
Both cultivars were affected remarkably when [$fungus#Virus*] infection was combined with salt stress however; cv Sardes was found out to be relatively tolerant with sustainable growth performance, better leaf water status and lower lipid peroxidation levels under this condition.
This relative tolerance could be related to the fine tuning of the activities of the antioxidative enzymes and proline levels.
