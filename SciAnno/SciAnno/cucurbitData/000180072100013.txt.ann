Ten days after pollination, young [@watermelon#Plant*] fruits were grafted to [$watermelon#Plant*] plants by [$using a surgical adhesive (Aron Alpha)#Method*].
One half of the grafted fruits were adhered successfully and developed to maturity.
However, they had more empty seeds than non-grafted fruits, and some of them developed [@hollow hearts#Disease*].
This new method of fruit grafting will help in the analysis of factors affecting parthenocarpy, embryo development, and the occurrence of [$hollow hearts#Disease*] in the fruit of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Furthermore, it will also assist in the development of a new method for producing seedless fruit.
