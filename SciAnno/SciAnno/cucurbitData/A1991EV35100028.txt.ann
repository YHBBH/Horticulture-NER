 A variant of [@zucchini yellow mosaic virus ZYMV#Virus*] ([$ZYMV-WK#Plant*]) that induced mild foliar mottle but no fruit symptoms on [$cucurbits#Plant*] was selected from a poorly aphid-transmissible isolate that induced severe symptoms.
 This mild variant could not be differentiated from its originating isolate serologically, by its host range, or by aphid transmissibility.
 [$ZYMV-WK#Plant*] reduced the marketable fruit production of [$zucchini squash#Plant*] only slightly when plants were infected at the seedling stage.
 In field trials conducted in France in 1988 and 1989, [$ZYMV-WK#Plant*] proved to be very efficient in protecting two cultivars of [$zucchini squash#Plant*] from severe [$ZYMV#Virus*] under intense disease pressure.
 Increase in weight of marketable fruit in cross-protected plots was up to 14.7 times that in unprotected plots.
