[@Cucurbits#Plant*] are well-studied models for phloem biology but unusually possess both fascicular phloem (FP) within vascular bundles and additional extrafascicular phloem (EFP).
Although the functional differences between the two systems are not yet clear, sugar analysis and limited protein profiling have established that FP and EFP have divergent compositions.
Here we report a detailed comparative proteomics study of FP and EFP in two [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
We re-examined the sites of exudation by video microscopy, and confirmed that in both species, the spontaneous exudate following tissue cutting derives almost exclusively from EFP.
Comparative [$gel electrophoresis#Method*] and mass spectrometry-based proteomics of exudates, sieve element contents and microdissected stem tissues established that EFP and FP profiles are highly dissimilar, and that there are also species differences.
Searches against [$cucurbit #Plant*]databases enabled identification of more than 300 FP proteins from each species.
Few of the detected proteins (about 10%) were shared between the sieve element contents of FP and EFP, and enriched Gene Ontology categories also differed.
To explore quantitative differences in the proteomes, we developed multiple reaction monitoring methods for [$cucumber#Plant*] proteins that are representative markers for FP or EFP and assessed exudate composition at different times after tissue cutting.
Based on failure to detect FP markers in exudate samples, we conclude that FP is blocked very rapidly and therefore makes a minimal contribution to the exudates.
Overall, the highly divergent contents of FP and EFP indicate that they are substantially independent vascular compartments.
   Significance Statement [$Cucurbits#Plant*] are phloem model plants partly because sap exudate is easy to collect, but they unusually possess both fascicular phloem (FP) within va[$scular #Method*]bundles and additional extrafascicular phloem (EFP), leading to hot debates on the origins of the exudate and uncertainty about the underlying differences between these two systems.
Here, comparison of the two proteomes reveals little overlap, suggesting not only spatial separation but functional divergence.
