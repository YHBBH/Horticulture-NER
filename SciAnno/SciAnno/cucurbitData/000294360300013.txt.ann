[@Downy mildew#Disease*] inflicts severe damage on [$cucurbits#Plant*] in humid areas of production throughout the world.
The genetics of resistance to [$downy mildew#Virus*] ([$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*]) in the [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) was studied by the means of a half diallel table between 6 inbred lines.
Decomposition of dominance variation indicated that the dominance effect was not unidirectional and that dominant genes were not uniformly distributed among the parents.
These facts were confirmed and using a further detailed Hayman's graphical analysis.
Narrow-sense heritability estimates were 0.42 so the breeders are able to use selection for this trait.
In other hands the heterosis in some crosses was high so breeders are able to use specific cross to produce hybrid with high level resistance.
