[@Pepper#Plant*] ([$Capsicum annuum#Plant*]) is an important [$crop#Plant*] worldwide.
In Israel, approximately 2,500 ha are grown all year round for the local and export markets.
Herein, we report the identification of a viral [$pathogen#Virus*] causing a new devastating disease in [$pepper#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
The disease syndrome includes shortening of stem internodes, interveinal yellowing, and upward rolling of the leaf blade, accompanied by fruit discoloration and size reduction.
[$Virus#Virus*] purification from infected plants yielded isometric particles, 25 nm in diameter.
The causal agent of the disease was tentatively named [@Pepper yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([@PYLCV#Virus*]).
The virus cross-reacted in DAS ELISA with antisera against [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] and [$Potato leafroll virus#Virus*], members of the [$Polerovirus genus#Virus*].
The partial nucleotide sequence obtained from the cloned viral [$coat protein#Gene*] and movement protein genes indicated 92% identity at the amino acid level with [@Tobacco vein distortion virus#Virus*] ([@TVDV#Virus*]), another member of the [$Polerovirus genus#Virus*].
However, the host range of [$PYLCV#Virus*] is significantly different from the host range described for [$TVDV#Virus*].
Based on our findings, the taxonomic status of [$PYLCV#Virus*] is discussed.
