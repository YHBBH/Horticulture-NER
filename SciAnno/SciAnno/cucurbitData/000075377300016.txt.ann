Although plants generally show maternal transmission of the organellar genomes, previous research has demonstrated that the mitochondrial (mt) genome of [@cucumber#Plant*] is paternally transmitted.
In this study, we identified [@RFLPs#Gene*] in the organellar genomes of [$melon#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] to establish organellar DNA transmission.
Serial dilutions of DNA demonstrated that our hybridizations revealed the presence of a polymorphic cytoplasm when it represented at least 1% of the DNA sample.
At this level of sensitivity, the chloroplast genomes of [$melon#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] were maternally transmitted.
The mitochondrial genomes of [$squash#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] were maternally transmitted; however, [$melon#Plant*], like [$cucumber#Plant*], showed paternal transmission of the mitochondrial genome.
Because most angiosperms and the related genera [$Cucurbita#Plant*] and [$Citrullus#Plant*] show maternal transmission of the mtDNA, paternal transmission in [$Cucumis#Plant*] is likely the derived state.
The [$Cucumis#Plant*] mitochondrial genomes are several-fold larger than those of other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Based on 55 probe-enzyme combinations, mtDNA size differences could not be explained by duplication of the entire genome or partial duplication of regions hybridizing with the mitochondrial probes.
Because the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes of [$Cucumis#Plant*] are differentially transmitted, this genus is an excellent system to study the role of intergenomic transfer in the evolution of extremely large mitochondrial genomes.
