[@Cucurbid downy mildew#Disease*], a disease caused by the oomycete [$pathogen#Virus*] [@Pseudo-peronospora cubensis (Berk.& Curt.) Rostov.#Virus*], is a serious threat to [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]) production worldwide and can result in 100% yield losses in affected environments.
In the last decade, strains of the [$pathogen#Virus*] have overcome the resistance of commercial cultivars in the United States, and currently no cultivar has robust resistance to the disease.
This lack of resistance has been especially problematic for [$cucumber#Plant*] growers seeking to capture the late-season market, when [$downy mildew#Virus*] is ubiquitous throughout Eastern and Great Lakes production environments.
Our objectives were to identify sources of resistance genes and to introgress these genes into high-quality, high-yielding breeding material.
Using the moderately resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] cultivars Marketmore 97 and Ivory Queen as well as the Cornell-developed cultivars Platinum and Salt & [$Pepper#Plant*], we have developed lines with excellent disease resistance.
In a trial of 27 lines that included Cornell breeding material and the most resistant cultivars and U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) accessions identified in previous studies, the Cornell breeding line DMR-NY264 had the highest level of [$downy mildew#Virus*] resistance and the highest yields under disease pressure.
In New York, plants of DMR-NY 264 produced fruit until frost without fungicide application.
