[@Watermelon#Plant*] seeds can become infested by [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]) of [$cucurbits#Plant*] via penetration of the ovary pericarp or by invasion of the pistil.
This study investigated the effect of these invasion pathways on [$A.citrulli #Virus*]localization in seeds.
Seed samples (n == 20 or 50 seeds/lot) from pistil- and pericarp-inoculated lots were dissected into testa, perisperm-endosperm (PE) layer, and embryo tissues and tested for [$A.citrulli #Virus*]by [@species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)#Method*] and by [@plating on semiselective media#Method*].
Less than 8% of the testa samples were [$A.citrulli#Virus*]-positive regardless of the method of seed inoculation.
Additionally, the difference in percentages of contaminated testae between the two seed lot types was not significant (P == 0.64).
The percentage of [$A.citrulli#Virus*]-positive PE layer samples as determined by [@real-time PCR assay #Method*]was significantly greater for seeds from pistil-inoculated lots (97%) than for seeds from pericarp-inoculated lots (80.3%).
The mean percentage of [$A.citrulli#Virus*]-positive embryo samples was significantly greater for seeds from pistil-inoculated lots (94%) than for seeds from pericarp-inoculated lots (approximate to a parts per thousand 8.8%) (P == 0.0001).
Removal of PE layers and testae resulted in a significant reduction in [$BFB#Disease*] seed-to-seedling transmission percentage for seeds from pericarp-inoculated lots (14.8%) relative to those from pistil-inoculated lots (72%).
Additionally, using immunofluorescence microscopy, [$A.citrulli #Virus*]cells were observed in the PE layers and the cotyledons of pistil-inoculated seeds but only in the PE layers of pericarp-inoculated seeds.
These results suggest that pericarp invasion results in superficial contamination of the testae and PE layers while pistil invasion results in the deposition of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]in seed embryos.
