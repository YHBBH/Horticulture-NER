[@Fusarium wilt diseases#Disease*], caused by formae speciales of the [$fungus#Virus*] [$Fusarium oxysporum#Virus*] are a serious problem for the production of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and other plants around the world.
In this study, the possibility of applying a novel fumigation agent to the soil was investigated as a strategy for controlling [@F.oxysporum f.sp.cucumerinum#Virus*] ([@FOC#Virus*]), [@F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] ([@FUN#Virus*]), and [$F.oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] ([$FOM#Virus*]).
The fumigation agent ammonium bicarbonate, which releases ammonia, was investigated when applied alone and with lime as a direct soil amendment under sealed conditions.
For the [$FOC#Virus*], [$FUN#Virus*] and [$FOM#Virus*], the suitable additive concentrations of ammonium bicarbonate were 2,2 and 1.5 g kg(-1) soil dry weight (DW), respectively, when applied alone.
These concentrations produced the best effects when short processing times, broad temperature ranges and wide soil moisture contents were used.
Ammonium bicarbonate had a stronger antifungal effect when mixed with lime than when applied alone in the pot experiments.
In the [$field experiment#Method*], stronger antifungal effects were observed when the pH value of the soil was less than 7, and no significant difference between the two treatments was observed in alkaline soil.
This study explored a novel fumigation agent for controlling [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]that was based on ammonium bicarbonate and provided a potential strategy for ensuring healthy [$cucumber#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon crops#Plant*] and supporting the worldwide development of these [$crop#Plant*]ping industries.
