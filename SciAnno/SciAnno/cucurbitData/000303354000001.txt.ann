Symptoms reminiscent of phytoplasma infection were observed in four provinces (governorates) of Egypt in fields of [@eggplants#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*] plants and [$squash#Plant*].
Diseased plants exhibited stunting, leaf yellows and flower development abnormalities.
[@PCR amplification of 16SrDNA with phytoplasma-specific primer pairs#Method*] confirmed the phytoplasma presence.
Sequencing and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] indicated that all phytoplasmas had the same partial 16SrDNA sequence, assigning them to the 16SrII-D phytoplasma subgroup.
Disease incidence was about 1% among the 20 [$squash #Plant*]fields surveyed and equally varied from 4% to 15% in the 20 [$eggplant#Plant*] fields and in the 40 [$tomato#Plant*] fields inspected.
The widespread distribution of this phytoplasma in annual [$solanaceous #Plant*]and [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] suggests a wider plant host range including [$wild plants#Plant*] that could act as reservoir and insist on the need for a insect vector survey.
A finer genetic differentiation of Egyptian 16SrII-D phytoplasma strains from different geographical origins and different [$host plants#Plant*] should help to better trace such epidemics.
