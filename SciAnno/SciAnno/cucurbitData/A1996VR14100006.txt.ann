Plant samples from important horticultural areas in Mexico and the southern United States were collected during several seasons and analyzed for the presence of geminiviruses by [@a combination of agarose gel electrophoresis#Method*], [@molecular hybridization#Method*], and [@polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques#Method*].
A general detection strategy confirmed the presence of geminiviruses in all horticultural areas of Mexico in [$pepper#Plant*].
[$tomato#Plant*], [@tomatillo#Plant*] ([@Physalis ixocarpa#Plant*]), [$cucurbits#Plant*], and [$tobacco#Plant*].
Specific detection procedures showed that [@pepper huasteco virus#Virus*] is widely distributed in Mexico; it was found in [$pepper#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] samples in both coastal areas, as well as in central Mexico.
It was also found in [$pepper#Plant*] samples from the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas.
[@Pepper jalapeno virus#Virus*] ([@PJV#Virus*]) and [@chino del tomate virus#Virus*] ([@CdTV#Virus*]) showed a more restricted distribution, although, in all cases, the viruses appeared to become more widely distributed over time.
Partial DNA sequences of [$PJV#Virus*] and [$CdTV#Virus*] were also obtained.
Comparative [$sequence analysis#Method*] showed that [$PJV#Virus*] and the previously described Texas [@pepper geminivirus#Virus*] are probably strains of the same virus.
The name [@pepper jalapeno virus#Virus*] is, thus, withdrawn to avoid further confusion.
Similarly, [$CdTV#Virus*] showed a very high level of sequence identity with the recently described [@tomato leaf crumple virus#Virus*] ([@TLCrV#Virus*]), also suggesting that they both are strains of the same virus.
