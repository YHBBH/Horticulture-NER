Inbred lines derived from the [@Chinese cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) cultivar, 'Taichung Mou Gua' (TMG), have been shown to be resistant to several [$potyviruses#Virus*] including: [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [@zucchini yellow fleck virus#Virus*] ([@ZYFV#Virus*]), [$watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) and the [$watermelon#Plant*] strain of [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]).
Recently, an additional virus that infects [$cucurbits#Plant*], the [$Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MWMV#Virus*]), has been determined to be a distinct member of the [$potyvirus#Virus*] group.
This study demonstrates that TMG-1 possesses resistance to [$MWMV#Virus*].
Rub or [$aphid#Virus*] inoculated TMG-1 [$seedlings#Plant*] remain free of symptoms.
Progeny analyses of the F-1, F-2 and backcross generations show that resistance to [$MWMV#Virus*] is conferred by a single recessive gene (proposed designation, mwm).
Sequential inoculation of progeny possessing resistance to [$ZYMV#Virus*] followed by [$MWMV#Virus*] (or [$MWMV#Virus*] followed by [$ZYMV#Virus*]) and analysis of F-3 families derived from F-2 individuals selected for resistance to [$ZYMV#Virus*] indicate that both resistances are conferred by the same gene, or two tightly linked genes.
