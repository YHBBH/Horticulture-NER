Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) undergoes light- or diurnally-regulated changes in phosphorylation in C-3 and CAM plants but only in some C-4 plants.
The characteristics of this phosphorylation of PEPCK and its possible regulatory significance are discussed.
The molecular mass of PEPCK from C-4 plants is often smaller, and more variable, than the molecular mass of the enzyme in C-3 and CAM plants.
These differences probably reflect differences in the size of the N-terminal extension found in the enzyme from higher plants.
This N-terminal extension contains the phosphorylation site and it is readily cleaved following extraction.
PEPCK has four well-defined roles in plants: in photosynthesis in C-4 and CAM plants, in the CO2-concentrating mechanism of certain algae and in gluconeogenesis following germination of fat-storing [$seedlings#Plant*], but it has now also been located in the trichomes and in the phloem of some plants, such as [$cucurbits#Plant*], suggesting a larger number of roles in plant metabolism than has hitherto been recognised.
These possible roles are discussed, and in particular we discuss the general role of the phloem elements in [@cucurbits#Plant*].
