A complementary RNA (cRNA) probe, BMI, was prepared by transcription of a 1,061 nucleotide cDNA fragment complementary to nucleotides 1 to 1,061 (open reading frame [ORF] 1) within the sequence of a French [$sugar beet#Plant*]-infecting [@beet mild yellowing luteovirus#Virus*] ([@BMYV#Virus*])-2ITB isolate.
This probe detected specifically the homologous isolate as well as 14 other [$BMYV#Virus*] isolates collected from [$sugar beet#Plant*] grown in various areas, mainly in Europe.
It did not hybridize with non[$beet#Plant*]-infecting isolates of the closely related [@beet western yellows luteovirus#Virus*] ([$BWYV#Virus*]) or [$cucurbit aphid-borne yellows luteoviru#Virus*]s ([$CABYV#Virus*])-N isolate, but reacted weakly with two English [$BMYV#Virus*] isolates that do not infect Capsella bursa-pastoris or Montia perfoliata.
The probe BMI detected [$BMYV#Virus*] in single [$Myzus persicae#Virus*], giving no reaction with nonviruliferous individuals.
As a comparison, a second [$BMYV#Virus*] probe (BM2) was produced to the [$coat protein gene#Gene*] (ORF 4) of the French [$BMYV#Virus*]-2ITB isolate.
This probe detected all [$BMYV#Virus*], [$BWYV#Virus*] and [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates, highlighting the closer sequence homology within this region among Subgroup 2 [$luteoviruses#Virus*].
The dilution end-point for the detection of virus from infected material by radioactively labeled probes was 1:500, and about 250 fg of viral RNA could be detected from purified virions preparations.
Non-radioactively labeled (digoxigenin [DIG]) probes were found to be 30-fold less sensitive than radioactive cRNA probes, Probe BM1 has potential for large-scale screening with applications in epidemiology and [$sugar beet#Plant*]-breeding programs.
This report shows that heterogeneity at the 5' proximal regions of the genomes of [$BMYV#Virus*] and [$BWYV#Virus*] offers the potential for discriminating between the two viruses and identifying the [$sugar beet#Plant*]-infecting [$BMYV#Virus*] isolates.
