[@Fusarium wilt#Disease*] [caused by the [$fungus#Virus*] [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] (FON)] has been a consistent problem in [$watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.and Nakai#Plant*]] production worldwide.
One method for combatting this [$pathogen#Virus*] in the field is to graft a susceptible, high-yielding scion on to a fusarium wilt-resistant rootstock.
A concerning issue with rootstocks resistant to fusarium wilt is that they have not been tested for their susceptibility to plant pathogenic [@nematodes#Disease*]-specifically, [@root-knot nematodes#Disease*] ([$RKN#Virus*]s; [$Meloidogyne spp.#Virus*]) and the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis).
Preliminary findings have demonstrated that many of these [$Fusarium#Virus*]-resistant rootstocks are highly susceptible to [$RKN#Virus*]s.
Research was conducted during the Spring and Fall 2015 and 2016 to evaluate the resistance to [$RKN#Virus*] and reniform nematode in rootstocks with known resistance to fusarium wilt.
Six rootstocks were evaluated over the course of four experiments.
A nematode-susceptible interspecific hybrid [[@Cucurbitamaxima (Duchesne) #Plant*]x [$C.moschata#Plant*] (Duchesne)] rootstock 'Carnivor' was included as a susceptible control in both years.
Results demonstrated that several [$Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] (L.H.Bailey) rootstocks ('Carolina Strongback', USVL246-FR2, USVL252-FR2, and USVL-360) and 'SP-6' (a commercially available pollinizer cultivar) exhibited resistance to plant parasitic [@nematodes#Disease*] when compared with the susceptible control.
Partial resistance was observed in USVL-482351.
When compared with the control, these rootstocks also had fewer [$Meloidogyne spp.#Virus*]and R.reniformis in root tissue.
These findings indicate that rootstocks may be available to manage both fusarium wilt and [$RKN#Virus*] in grafted [$cucurbit #Plant*]production system.
