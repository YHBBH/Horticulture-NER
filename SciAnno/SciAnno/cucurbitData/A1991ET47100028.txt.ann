[@Squash leaf curl#Disease*] ([@SLC#Disease*]) is a virus disease of [$squash #Plant*]transmitted by the [$sweetpotato#Plant*] [$whitefly#Virus*] [[@Bemisia tabaci (Genn.)#Virus*]].
 [@Cucurbita maxima Duch.ex Lam.#Plant*], [@C.mixta Pang#Plant*], and [@C.pepo L.cultivars#Plant*] and the wild taxon [@C.texana Gray#Plant*] exhibited severe symptoms in response to [$SLC#Disease*] in g[$reenhouse#Virus*] and field tests.
 Symptoms on [@C.moschata (Duch.) Duch.ex Poir.cultivars#Plant*] were much more severe in [$greenhouse tests#Method*] than in field tests.
 Three wild species, [@C.ecuadorensis Cutler#Plant*] and Whitaker, [@C.lundelliana Bailey#Plant*], and [@C.martinezii Bailey#Plant*], were virtually immune in [$greenhouse tests#Method*], but were infected in field tests.
[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] foetidissima HBK expressed moderate symptoms in a field test.
 [$Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn.#Plant*], [@C.ficifolia Bouche#Plant*], [$Lagenaria siceraria (Mol.) Standl.#Plant*], [$Luffa acutangula (L.) Roxb.#Plant*], [@Luffa aegyptiaca Mill.#Plant*], and [@Luffa graveolens Roxb.#Plant*]
were resistant to [$SLC#Disease*] in greenhouse and field tests.
