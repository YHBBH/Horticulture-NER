The potential of [@herbaceous weeds#Plant*] commonly growing in or adjacent to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] to serve as alternate hosts and overwintering reservoirs of [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*], a causal agent of [@cucurbit wilt#Disease*], was investigated.
Methods for isolation, maintenance, long-term storage,and detection of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] from infected plants were developed.
[@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] was consistently detected by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([@ELISA#Method*]) and reisolated from infected, susceptible, [$cucurbit#Plant*] species.
When six common [@herbaceous weed#Plant*] species were inoculated, [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] was detected in 49% (combined species) of the plants by [$ELISA#Method*] 3 weeks after inoculation.
However, we were unable to reisolate [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] from these plants by standard techniques.
[@Immunoaffinity isolation with a sensitivity of 2 CFU#Method*] per sample also failed to recover [$E.tracheiphila#Virus*] from [$weed#Plant*] species.
Comparisons of [$cucumber#Plant*] and goldenrod inoculated with live or formaldehyde-killed [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] indicated that immunoassays could detect nonviable [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] systemically spread in plants 3 weeks post-inoculation.
In these tests, the pathogen was reisolated only from [$cucumber#Plant*] plants inoculated with live [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*].
Although we could reproduce serological evidence of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] antigen in the [$weeds#Plant*] investigated, our results do not support the hypothesis that E.
tracheiphila can infect, survive in.
or overwinter in the [$weed#Plant*] species tested.
