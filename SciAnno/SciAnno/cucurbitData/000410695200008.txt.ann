Four crop-infecting [$begomoviruses#Virus*] were found naturally affecting Charlock mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.) plants in Jordan and characterized at the molecular level.
Symptoms included leaf curling and stunting.
[$PCR#Method*] analysis showed the presence of [$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([$TYLCV#Virus*]), [$Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus#Virus*] ([$TYLCSV#Virus*]), [$Squash leaf curl virus#Plant*] ([$SLCV#Virus*]) and [$Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]).
These viruses were associated with Cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite (CLCuG beta).
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] revealed that [$TYLCV#Virus*] and [$TYLCSV#Virus*] had 98.5% and 99.3% nucleotide (nt) sequence identities with a previously described [$TYLCV#Virus*] strain from Florida and [$TYLCSV#Virus*] from Sardinia, respectively.
The other two viruses, [$SLCV#Virus*]and [$WmCSV#Virus*], shared 99.7% and 99.5% nt identities with previously described strains from Jordan.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] also showed that CLCuG beta had 98.8% nt identity with a strain from Israel.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of S.arvensis as a natural host of [$SLCV#Virus*], [$WmCSV#Virus*], [$TYLCSV#Virus*] and CLCuG beta.
