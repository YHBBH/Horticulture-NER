A total of 134 Czech [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] isolates originating from [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] were used for fungicide resistance screening.
Efficacy of six commonly used and registered fungicides was screened in Czech [@P.cubensis#Virus*] populations.
The investigations covered the frequency and occurrence of sensitive, moderately resistant and resistant isolates to the individual fungicides during the period 2005-2010.
Fosetyl-Al (Aliette 80 W) and propamocarb (Previcur 607 SL) were the most effective fungicides.
All tested isolates were sensitive on all tested fosetyl-Al concentrations.
However, some isolates expressed resistance (profuse sporulation) or moderate resistance (limited sporulation) to lower and/or even to recommended concentrations of propamocarb in the years 2006 and 2008-2010.
Metalaxyl (Ridomil PLUS 48 WP) and metalaxyl-M (Ridomil Gold MZ 68 WP) were ineffective.
Isolates collected in 2008 and 2009 showed large variation in moderate resistance or resistance even at high fungicide dosages.
However, this result was not confirmed in 2010, when efficacy of these fungicides increased slightly, and 69% and 43% of isolates were controlled at the recommended concentration of metalaxyl-M and metalaxyl, respectively.
Limited or profuse sporulation was observed only sporadically at high concentrations.
Sensitivity of isolates to cymoxanil (Curzate K) differed among the studied years.
While cymoxanil was ineffective in the years 2005-2008 and in 2010,68% of isolates were controlled at the recommended concentration in 2009.
During the years 2005 through 2010, a shift towards higher sensitivity to dimethomorph was observed at all screened concentrations.
