The [@watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]) 'AU-Performance' was developed for resistance to multiple [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] and the plant virus, [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
A greenhouse-based evaluation was carried out to determine the response of 'AU-Performance' to inoculation with three important [$cucurbit #Plant*]([$Cucurbitaceae#Plant*]) viruses in the [$genus Potyvirus#Virus*]: [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), and [$ZYMV#Virus*].
The evaluation included the resistant parent (PI595203), the susceptible parent ('AU-Producer'), and varieties AU-All[$sweet#Plant*] and Charleston Gray.
Each of the three viruses systemically infected 'AU-Performance' with 100% infection and development of characteristic systemic symptoms.
The susceptible parent ('AU-Producer'), 'AU-All[$sweet#Plant*]', and 'Charleston Gray' responded similarly with 100% infection and systemic symptoms.
In contrast, the resistant parent (PI595203) was resistant to [$WMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*]; however, [$PRSV#Virus*]-inoculated plants developed a systemic infection with accompanied symptoms and high levels of [$PRSV#Virus*] accumulation in noninoculated leaves.
PI595203 was shown in previous studies to be resistant to [$PRSV#Virus*].
We show in this report that under greenhouse conditions and application of virus by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*], 'AU-Performance' was not resistant to infection by the three [$potyviruses#Virus*].
