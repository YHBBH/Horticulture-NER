[@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] causes severe losses in [$vegetable#Plant*] production, including many [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
Our previous work showed that [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) fruit are most susceptible to [@P.capsici#Virus*] when they are very young and rapidly elongating, but develop resistance as they approach full length at 10 to 12 days postpollination (DPP).
In this study, fruit from seven additional [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] representing four species, [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$butternut squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]), [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]), and [$zucchini#Plant*], [$yellow summer squash#Plant*], [$acorn squash#Plant*], and [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), were tested for the effect of fruit development on susceptibility to [$P.capsici#Virus*].
Field-grown fruit of the different [$crops#Plant*] varied in overall susceptibility.
[$Zucchini#Plant*] and [$yellow summer squash#Plant*] were the most susceptible, with the majority of fruit exhibiting water-soaking symptoms within 24 hours postinoculation.
Fruit from all of the [$crops#Plant*] exhibited size-related decrease in susceptibility, but to varying degrees.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] had the most pronounced effect.
In infested fields, [$cucumber#Plant*] fruit were found to be most frequently infected at the blossom end.
Comparison of the peduncle and blossom end showed a difference in susceptibility along the length of the fruit for [$cucumber#Plant*], [$butternut squash#Plant*], and [$zucchini#Plant*].
Greenhouse-grown, hand-pollinated [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$acorn squash#Plant*], and [$butternut squash#Plant*] showed an age-related decrease in susceptibility similar to field-grown fruit.
For all of these fruit, a pronounced reduction in susceptibility accompanied the transition from the waxy green to green stage at 3 to 8 DPP.
