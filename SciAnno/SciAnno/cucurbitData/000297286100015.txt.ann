A [@field experiment #Method*]was conducted with a view to understand the fruit infestation rate by [@fruit fly#Virus*], [@Bactrocera cucurbitae #Virus*]on [$ash gourd#Plant*], [@ridge gourd#Plant*], [$sweet#Plant*] [$gourd#Virus*], [$bitter gourd#Plant*] and [$snake gourd#Plant*], and life history of the fly on these [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*] were studied in laboratory condition.
The highest (71.5%) and lowest (21.0%) fruit infestation rate were observed on [$sweet#Plant*] [$gourd#Virus*] and [$ridge gourd#Plant*], respectively and the results were statistically different.
Life history parameters indicated that the pre-mating durations of the flies were found 2.5 to 4.5 days.
The highest fecundity and hatching rate were observed on [$sweet#Plant*] [$gourd#Virus*] (56.2 female(-1) and 53.5%) and that were lowest on [$ridge gourd#Plant*] (36.7 female(-1) and 34.8%).
Incubation periods varied from 18.3 to 25.0 hours and the shortest period was found on [$sweet#Plant*] [$gourd#Virus*].
Pre-oviposition, oviposition, larval and pupal periods, and adult male and female longevity varied from 10.8 to 15.7, 5.5 to 9.5, 11.3 to 15.3, 7.3 to 10.5, 11.3 to 17.3 and 15.0 to 20.8 days, respectively.
The highest infestation rate while shortest premating, pre-oviposition, incubation, larval and pupal periods on [$sweet#Plant*] [$gourd#Virus*] indicated that this plant is the most favorable host for B.
[$cucurbitae#Plant*] among the studied [$crops#Plant*].
