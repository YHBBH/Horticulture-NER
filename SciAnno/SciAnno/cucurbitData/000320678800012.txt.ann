A method was developed [@using a padlock probe (PLP) and dot-blot hybridization#Method*] for detecting [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] in [$cucurbit #Plant*]seed.
The PLP was designed based on the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA sequence from [$A.citrulli#Virus*].
The detection threshold for the [@PLP assay#Method*] was 100 fg of genomic DNA, and [$A.citrulli #Virus*]was detected in 100% of artificially infested seedlots with 0.1% infestation or greater.
In addition, using the [$PLP assay#Method*], 4 of 8 [$melon#Plant*] seedlots collected from Xinjang province and 15 of 47 [$watermelon#Plant*] seedlots collected from Ningxia province were positive for [$A.citrulli#Virus*].
In contrast, a conventional [$polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay#Method*] that relied on primers WFB1 and WFB2 facilitated [$A.citrulli #Virus*]detection in 1 of 8 and 5 of 47 seedlots from Xinjiang and Ningxia provinces, respectively.
These data indicate that the [@PLP and dot-blot hybridization technique#Method*] was more effective than conventional [$PCR#Method*] for seed health testing.
