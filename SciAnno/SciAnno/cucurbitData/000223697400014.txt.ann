We conducted experiments in 2000 and 2001 in California's San Joaquin Valley to evaluate the effectiveness of [@wheat#Plant*] straw and UV reflective plastic mulches for the management of [$silverleaf whitefly#Virus*], [$Bemisia argentifolii Bellows and Perring#Virus*], and several [@aphid-borne virus diseases#Disease*] of [$zucchini squash#Plant*].
The effectiveness of these mulches was compared to a pre-plant application of imidacloprid (Admire(R)) insecticide and an unmulched, untreated control.
Symptoms of both [@squash silverleaf#Plant*], induced by nymphal [$whitefly#Virus*] feeding, and virus infection were significantly delayed and reduced by the baled [$wheat straw#Plant*] that was scattered over the beds and the UV reflective plastic.
Wheat [$straw#Plant*] mulch obtained by planting winter (December) [$wheat#Plant*], threshing the grain (June) and cutting the [$stubble#Plant*] (August) prior to [$squash #Plant*]planting discolored between harvest and [$squash #Plant*]planting and did not provide the high degree of reflectivity observed in straw that has been cut immediately after harvest, baled and then scattered prior to planting.
Pre-plant Admire insecticide was not as effective in managing either whiteflies or the virus diseases as were the mulches.
Yield of marketable fruit was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 2000 from plants growing over the scattered [$wheat straw#Plant*] and the UV reflective plastic mulches than from those growing in the Admire treated or the control plots.
In 2001 plants growing over the scattered [$wheat straw#Plant*] produced yields significantly (P < 0.05) greater than those from all other treatments.
These data indicate that acceptable [$squash #Plant*]yields can be obtained without using chemical insecticides.
