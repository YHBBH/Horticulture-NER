[@Squash leaf curl (SLC) disease#Disease*] causes serious damage in a great diversity of [$horticultural crops#Plant*] worldwide and is due to infection by different ssDNA bipartite [$begomoviruses#Virus*] ([@Family Geminiviridae#Virus*]).
Symptoms of leaf yellowing, stunting and curling have been observed in [$squash #Plant*][$crops#Plant*] in the southern region of the Baja California (BC) Peninsula in the northwestern region of Mexico for at least a decade.
The damage estimated for all localities showed disease incidence of 73.3% to 97.7% and severity of 49%.
Infected plants were collected in three localities in addition to adult [$whiteflies#Virus*] for species determination.
[$Squash leaf curl virus#Plant*] ([@SLCuV#Virus*]) was detected in both infected plants and [$whiteflies#Virus*] by [@PCR using specific primers #Method*]that amplified a 601 bp fragment.
The full-length DNA-A sequence was 99.1% identical to sequences in GenBank.
Phylogenetic studies using the core [$CP#Gene*] region showed that the BC isolate grouped within a well-defined clade together with [$SLCuV#Virus*] from the Mediterranean Middle East and USA.
The [$molecular analysis#Method*] in individual adult [$whiteflies#Virus*] determined that all populations belonged to [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] ([@MEAM1) (biotype B#Virus*]) species.
No evidence of the [@Mediterranean (MED) species (biotype Q)#Virus*] was found.
The [@SLC disease#Disease*] has prevailed in [$squash #Plant*]in the region in several growing cycles and in geographically separated localities.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of [$SLCuV#Virus*] associated with [$squash plant#Plant*]s in BCS, Mexico.
