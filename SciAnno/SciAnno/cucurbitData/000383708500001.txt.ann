Haploids and doubled haploids are critical components of plant breeding.
This review is focused on studies on haploids and double haploids inducted in [$cucurbits#Plant*] through in vitro pollination with irradiated pollen, unfertilized ovule/ovary culture, and anther/microspore culture during the last 30 years, as well as comprehensive analysis of the main factors of each process and comparison between chromosome doubling and ploidy identification methods, with special focus on the application of double haploids in plant breeding and genetics.
This review identifies existing problems affecting the efficiency of androgenesis, gynogenesis, and parthenogenesis in [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
Donor plant genotypes and surrounding environments, developmental stages of explants, culture media, stress factors, and chromosome doubling and ploidy identification are compared at length and discussed as methodologies and protocols for androgenesis, gynogenesis, and parthenogenesis in haploid and double haploid production technologies.
