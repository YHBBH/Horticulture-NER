Vegetable production using grafted seedling has become a common practice in many parts of the world.
Use of grafted seedling increased in greenhouses due to enhancement of fruit quality and increase yield where production faces with unsuitable suboptimal conditions from late fall to early spring such as low temperature, low light intensity, high humidity and salinity.
The study was conducted to determine the effect of grafting on the growth, yield and compatibility between scion and rootstocks during 2008-2009.
The popular greenhouse [$cucumber#Plant*] cultivar 'Khassib' was used as scion.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] graft on different rootstocks include 'RZ Ferro', 'RZ426', 'ES107', 'ES101', 'ES152', 'RS841', the landrace of [$winter squash#Plant*][$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata ('Halvaii'), [@Cucurbita pepo var.styriaca#Plant*] ('Post Kaghazi'),[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima ('Tanbal'), [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] ('Ghelyani').
Non-grafted [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] 'Khassib' was used as control.
The [$field experiment #Method*]was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications.
Hole insertion grafting technique was followed.
The result showed that the growth of the vine, precocity and total yield ws significantly influenced by grafting.
Grafted plants on 'RZ426' rootstock had higher yield and plant length compared to non grafted ones.
Survival rate of seedling were 85, 82, 76, 76, 74, 72, 68, 57, 53 and 48% for 'RZ426', 'Tanbal', 'RS841', 'ES101', 'Halvaii', 'ES152', 'ES107', 'RZ Ferro', 'Ghelyani' and 'Post Kaghazi' [$rootstocks#Plant*], respectively.
All [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
[$rootstocks#Plant*] were found acceptable for [$cucumber#Plant*].
However, RZ426 and the landrace of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima ('Tanbal') were the best.
