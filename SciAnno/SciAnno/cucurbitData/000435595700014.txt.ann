Map-based cloning identified a candidate gene for resistance to the [$anthracnose#Virus*] fungal [$pathogen#Virus*] [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*] in [$cucumber#Plant*], which reveals a novel function for the highly conserved STAYGREEN family genes for host disease resistance in plants.
   [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*] is a hemibiotrophic fungal [$pathogen#Virus*] that causes [@anthracnose disease#Disease*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] and other [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
No host resistance genes against the [@anthracnose#Disease*] [$pathogens#Virus*] have been cloned in [$crop#Plant*] plants.
Here, we reported fine mapping and cloning of a resistance gene to the race 1 [@anthracnose#Disease*] [$pathogen#Virus*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] inbred lines Gy14 and WI 2757.
Phenotypic and QTL analysis in multiple populations revealed that a single recessive gene, cla, was underlying [@anthracnose#Disease*] resistance in both lines, but WI2757 carried an additional minor-effect QTL.
Fine mapping using 150 Gy14 x 9930 recombinant inbred lines and 1043 F (2) individuals delimited the cla locus into a 32 kb region in [$cucumber#Plant*] Chromosome 5 with three predicted genes.
Multiple lines of evidence suggested that the [$cucumber#Plant*] [@STAYGREEN (CsSGR) gene#Gene*] is a candidate for the [@anthracnose#Disease*] resistance locus.
A single nucleotide mutation in the third exon of [@CsSGR#Gene*] resulted in the substitution of Glutamine in 9930 to Arginine in Gy14 in [$CsSGR#Gene*] protein which seems responsible for the differential [@anthracnose#Disease*] inoculation responses between Gy14 and 9930.
Quantitative [$real-time PCR#Method*] analysis indicated that [$CsSGR#Gene*] was significantly upregulated upon [@anthracnose#Disease*] [$pathogen#Virus*] inoculation in the susceptible 9930, while its expression was much lower in the resistant Gy14.
Investigation of allelic diversities in natural [$cucumber#Plant*] populations revealed that the resistance allele in almost all improved cultivars or breeding lines of the U.S.
origin was derived from PI 197087.
This work reveals an unknown function for the highly conserved STAYGREEN (SGR) family genes for host disease resistance in plants.
