Description of the subject.
The intercropping system is a beneficial method, which is widely used in tropical areas for sustainable soil fertility management, and has been found to improve both the yields of traditional agriculture and the income of small producers.
   Objectives.
The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effect of associated culture and pure culture of [$cucurbit #Plant*][$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] creeping plant and the variety of cassava Manihot esculenta var.'Bonoua Blanc' upright plant on the agronomic performance of each [$crop#Plant*].
   Method.
An experiment was established in randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment.
The treatments compared were firstly, associated [$crops#Plant*] [@M.esculenta var.'Bonoua Blanc' / L#Plant*].
siceraria with [$cucurbit #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*] at 0 days (CAT(0)), 15 days (CAT(15)), 30 days (CAT(30)) and 45 days (CAT(45)) after cassava; secondly, pure cultures of [$cucurbit #Plant*]on the same dates as for associated [$crops#Plant*] ([$CP#Gene*]T0, [$CP#Gene*]T15, [$CP#Gene*]T30 and [$CP#Gene*]T45), and thirdly, a pure culture of [$cassava#Plant*] at 0 days ([$CP#Gene*]).
Nine agronomic characteristics were analyzed in [$cucurbit #Plant*]and eight in cassava.
   Results.
The agronomic parameters evaluated were the yield components of cassava, which varied with the increase in seedling time of [$cucurbit#Virus*].
However, the performance of [$cucurbit #Plant*]decreased with the increase in [$seedlings#Plant*] either in the associated [$crop#Plant*] or in pure culture.
Performance also decreased sharply for the same sowing dates in pure culture.
Despite high productivity when [$cucurbit #Plant*]was simultaneously planted with [$cassava#Plant*], it remained low compared to the [$cucurbit #Plant*]pure [$crop#Plant*].
   Conclusions.
Inter[$crop#Plant*]ping of [$cucurbit #Plant*][$L.siceraria#Plant*] and cassava M.esculenta was not found to be beneficial to the yield of the individual [$crops#Plant*].
However, the use of [$cucurbit #Plant*]as an inter[$crop#Plant*]ping cover [$crop#Plant*] helps to conserve soil moisture and to manage arable land and [$weeds#Plant*] for the benefit of cassava [$crops#Plant*].
