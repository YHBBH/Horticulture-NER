The use of a row cover effectively reduced [@silverleaf whitefly#Virus*], [@Bemisia tabaci Biotype B#Virus*], densities in a field [@zucchini crop#Plant*].
The trial assessed yields and quality of [$zucchini#Plant*] under floating row covers where [$silverleaf whitefly#Virus*] had been introduced or not introduced, and with those in open plots where [$whitefly#Virus*] were introduced.
Floating row covers increased temperature and humidity compared with the uncovered treatment.
Total and average fruit weight and percent marketable fruit were less (P < 0.05) under row covers with [$silverleaf whitefly#Virus*] present.
Floating row covers may provide an effective alternative to pesticide use in small-scale [$cucurbit#Plant*] production.
