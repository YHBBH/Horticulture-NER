The [@Mildew resistance locus o (Mlo)#Gene*] is a plant-specific gene family that encodes a protein with seven-transmembrane (TM) domains that play an important role in plant resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] (PM).
PM caused by [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]is a widespread plant disease and represents the major fungal threat for many [$Cucurbits#Plant*].
The recently reported[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima genome sequence data provides an opportunity to identify and characterize the [@MLO gene#Gene*] family in this species.
A total of twenty genes designated [@CmaMLO1#Gene*] to [@CmaMLO20#Gene*] have been identified using an in silico cloning method with the [$MLO gene#Gene*] sequences of [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], and[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] as probes.
These [@CmaMLOs#Gene*] were evenly distributed on 15 of the 20 [$C.maxima#Plant*] chromosomes without any obvious clustering.
Multiple sequence alignment showed that common structural features of [$MLO gene#Gene*] family, such as TM domains, a calmodulin-binding domain, and 30 important amino acid residues for MLO function, were well conserved.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of the [@CmaMLO genes#Gene*] and other plant species revealed seven different clades (I through VII); however, clade IV is specific to monocots ([$rice#Plant*], [$barley#Plant*] and [$wheat#Plant*]).
Expression analysis showed that four of the five [$CmaMLO genes#Gene*] that belonged to clade V were up-regulated in [$pumpkins#Plant*] [$infe#Plant*]cted with [@P.xanthii#Virus*].
Phylogenetic and expression analysis provided preliminary evidence that these five genes could be susceptibility genes that are important for PM resistance.
This study is the first comprehensive report on [$MLO gene#Gene*]s in [$C.maxima#Plant*] to our knowledge.
These findings will facilitate the functional analysis of MLOs related to PM susceptibility and are valuable resources for the development of disease resistance in [$pumpkin#Plant*].
