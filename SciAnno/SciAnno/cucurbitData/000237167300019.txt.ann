[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), [$genus Crinivirus#Virus*] and [$family Closteroviridae#Virus*], has emerged as a serious [$whitefly#Virus*]-transmitted virus of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], causing between 30 and 50% yield losses.
Development of resistant cultivars represents an economically and environmentally sound approach to management of this disease.
In all, 124 [$Cucumber#Plant*] accessions were evaluated for reaction to [$CYSDV#Virus*] under high inoculum pressure over three growing seasons.
Seven accessions showed delayed expression of symptoms, milder final symptoms, and lower percentages of infected plants compared with susceptible [$cucumbers#Plant*].
Although none of these accessions were immune to [$CYSDV#Virus*], virus concentrations in the middle leaves of the tolerant accessions were significantly lower than those of susceptible accessions.
