A [@Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay#Method*] was employed to develop a simple and efficient system for the detection of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) in [$squash #Plant*]and [$melon plants#Plant*].
The [@RT-LAMP assay#Method*] took 30min under isothermal condition at 64 degrees C by employing a set of four primers targeting [$ZYMV#Virus*].
The sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 10-fold greater than that of the [$RT-PCR assay#Method*] in the detection of [$ZYMV#Virus*] in infected tissues of [$squash #Plant*]and [$melon#Plant*].
No reaction was detected from the tissues of healthy plants by either RT-LAMP or [$RT-PCR assay#Method*].
The [@RT-LAMP#Method*] product of the tested samples can be visualized by staining directly in the tube with SYBR Green I dye.
The sensitivity of SYBR Green I staining method is similar to that analyzed by [$gel electrophoresis#Method*].
Field-grown [$squash #Plant*]and [$melon plants#Plant*] were tested [$using RT-PCR#Method*] and [$RT-LAMP#Method*].
Both [@RT-LAMP and PCR#Method*] could detect [$ZYMV#Virus*] in symptomatic or symptomless tissues of infected plants.
However, the [$RT-LAMP assay#Method*] is superior to [$RT-PCR#Method*] because it is rapid, simple, and highly sensitive; therefore, [$RT-LAMP#Method*] is a useful and practical method for detection of [$ZYMV#Virus*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
