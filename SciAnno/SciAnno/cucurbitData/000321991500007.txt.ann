In an effort to develop [@bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) as a widely adapted rootstock for [$watermelon#Plant*] grafting, we sought to identify lines with broad resistance to several [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]that are economically important in the United States.
[@Preliminary analysis under greenhouse conditions#Method*] indicated that the currently available commercial [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstocks were either highly susceptible or somewhat tolerant to one or more viruses.
However, in greenhouse screening, several breeding lines of [$bottle gourd#Plant*] displayed broad-spectrum resistance to four viruses tested, including [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*], [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] [$watermelon#Plant*] strain ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), and [$Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*].
Resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] and [$WMV#Virus*] was confirmed through field trials in two consecutive years at two different locations in South Carolina.
Two breeding lines (USVL#1-8 and USVL#5-5) with broad-spectrum virus resistance could be useful materials for [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstock development.
