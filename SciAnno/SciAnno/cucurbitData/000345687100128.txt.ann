[@Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB)#Disease*], caused by [@Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] ([$Aac#Virus*]), is a serious disease of [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
In 1965, It was first reported in [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] of several plant introduction lines in Georgia.
But this [$pathogen#Virus*] attacked all of the world from the United States.
In Turkey, this [$pathogen#Virus*] has been observed for the first time in 1996.
There are a few studies with related to [$Aac#Virus*] resistance some [$cucurbits#Plant*] in the world, especially [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*].
But, there is no data on resistance of native [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Turkey.
The objective of this study is determining to resistance reactions of some [$cucurbits#Plant*] for [$Aac#Virus*].
Totally 62 genotypes (35[$ melons#Plant*], 23 [$cucumbers#Plant*] and 7 [$watermelon#Plant*]) and highly virulence [$Aac#Virus*] 26/11 isolate were used for resistance screening.
As a result, 7 genotypes (4 [$Cucumber#Plant*], 3 [$melon#Plant*]) were obtained resistant and other genotypes were fined susceptible for [$Aac#Virus*].
