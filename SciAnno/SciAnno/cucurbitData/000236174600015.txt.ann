[@Papaya ringspot virus-type W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) is the most prevalent and important viral [$pathogen#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Brazil.
It can be effectively controlled by the incorporation of genetic resistance into susceptible [$melon cultivars#Plant*].
The present study identified amplified fragment length polymorphic ([$AFLP#Method*]) markers linked to the [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resistance Prv(1) allele.
The susceptible yellow-fleshed [$melon#Plant*]-breeding line AF426(prv1) and its nearly isogenic-resistant line AF426(Prv1), which carries the Prv(1) allele resident in the Indian [$cantaloupe#Plant*] U.S.
Plant Introduction (PI) 180280, were screened for [$AFLP#Method*] marker polymorphisms.
Of 30 251 [$AFLP#Method*] loci, only three were polymorphic between the nearly isogenic lines.
[@Segregation analyses#Method*] for these three polymorphic markers and the Prv(1) allele using a BC1 population of 197 plants indicated close linkage (0.5% recombination frequency) between marker EK190 (HindIII-CGA and MseI-GTG; 190 bp) and Prv(1).
Thus, EK190 might be a useful marker in breeding programmes aiming to develop [$melon cultivars#Plant*] resistant to [$PRSV-W#Virus*].
The other two markers are closely linked to each other, but distantly linked to Prv(1).
