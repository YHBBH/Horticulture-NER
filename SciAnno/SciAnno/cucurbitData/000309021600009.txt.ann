Male sterile (MS) [@ridge gourd#Plant*] [[@Luffa acutangula (Roxb.) L.#Plant*]] mutant regenerated through in vitro culture was crossed with five pollen parents.
Four hybrids were (MS x CO.2, MS x Deepthi, MS x IC-92685, MS x IC-92671) male sterile whereas one (MS x Arka Sumeet) was partially fertile.
F-2 population of the cross (MS x Arka Sumeet) exhibited a good fit to the 9:7 (fertile:sterile) modified ratio indicating the role of complementary genes.
Two dominant fertility restorer genes (Rh1 and Rf2) either in homozygous dominantor heterozygous dominant condition restores the male fertility in presence of sterile cytoplasm.
Analysis of F-3 families validates the above hypothesis.
All three way crosses viz..
(MS x Deepthi) x Arka Sumeet, (MS x IC-92685) x Arka Sumeet, (MS x IC-92671) x Arka Sumeet and (MS x CO.2) x Arka Sumeet regained fertility indicating the presence of dominant fertility restorer genes in Arka Sumeet.
This is the first report of cytoplasmically controlled male sterility (CMS) in [$cucurbit #Plant*]where two dominant male fertility restorer nuclear genes with complementary gene action governing the restoration of male fertility.
