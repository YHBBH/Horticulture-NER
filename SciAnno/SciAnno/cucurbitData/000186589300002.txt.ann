[@Cucurbit seedlings#Plant*] potentially develop a peg on each side of the transition zone between the hypocotyl and root.
[$Seedlings #Plant*]grown in a horizontal position suppress the development of the peg on the upper side of the transition zone in response to gravity.
It is suggested that this suppression occurs due to a reduction in auxin levels to below the threshold value.
We show in this study that the free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content is low, while IAA conjugates are significantly more abundant in the upper side of the transition zone of gravistimulated [$seedlings#Plant*], compared to the lower side.
A transient increase in mRNA of the [@auxin-inducible gene#Gene*],[@ CS-IAA1#Gene*], was observed in the excised transition zone.
The result suggests that the transition zone is a source of auxin.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] treated with auxin-transport inhibitors exhibited agravitropic growth and developed a peg on each side of the transition zone.
Auxin-transport inhibitors additionally caused an increase in[$ CS-IAA1#Gene*] mRNA accumulation at the transition zone, indicating a rise in intracellular auxin concentrations due to a block of auxin efflux.
To study the involvement of the auxin transport system in peg formation, we isolated the cDNAs of a putative [@auxin influx carrier#Gene*], [@CS-AUX1#Gene*], and [@putative efflux carrier#Gene*], [@CS-PIN1#Gene*], from [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) plants.
Both genes ([$CS-AUX1#Gene*] in particular) were auxin-inducible.
Accumulation of [$CS-AUX1#Gene*] and [$CS-PIN1#Gene*] mRNAs was observed in vascular tissue, cortex and epidermis of the transition zone.
A reduced level of [$CS-AUX1#Gene*] mRNA was observed in the upper side of the gravistimulated transition zone, compared with the lower side.
It is therefore possible that a balance in the activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers controls intracellular auxin concentration at the transition zone, which results in lateral placement of a peg in [$cucumber#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*].
