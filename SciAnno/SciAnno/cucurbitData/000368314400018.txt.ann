Interspecific hybrid [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata#Plant*])is a well-known [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstock for controlling[$ soilborne disease#Disease*]s and improving abiotic stress tolerance.
However, reduced fruit quality has been reported on certain [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) cultivars when grafted with [$squash #Plant*]rootstocks.
In this study, a [$field experiment #Method*]was designed to explore fruit development and quality attributes of galia [$melon#Plant*] 'Arava' by grafting with hybrid [$squash #Plant*]rootstock 'Strong Tosa'.
Grafted plants with 'Strong Tosa' showed delayed anthesis of female flowers by days, but harvest dates were unaffected compared with non- and self-grafted 'Arava' plants.
Early and total yields were not significantly different between grafted and nongrafted plants.
Grafted plants with 'Strong Tosa' rootstock exhibited accelerated fruit development and greater vegetative growth.
During the harvest period, of grafted plants with 'Strong Tosa' wilted, which was determined as nonpathogenic.
Grafting with 'Strong Tosa' rootstock resulted in reduced fruit total soluble solids (TSS) and consumer rated sensory properties.
