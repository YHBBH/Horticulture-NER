The aim of this research was to determine the causal organisms of yellowing and vein clearing type of symptoms of [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber plants#Plant*] growing under greenhouse conditions, and which [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] biotypes are involved in transmission of viruses in Adana, Mersin and Antalya provinces.
For this purposes, the diseases [$surveys#Method*] were periodically made in 2010 and 2011, and [$whitefly#Virus*] vectors collected on the young leaves of the hosts from different district of [$cucurbits#Plant*] growing area.
The virus infected plants were tested against to [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]by [$PCR#Method*].
The result of work suggested that [$CVYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] are responsible for the disorders of the yellowing type of symptoms.
The infected plants showed mainly interveinal chlorosis and yellowing type of nutrition deficiency symptoms on the leaves.
Among the collected 134 [$melon#Plant*] samples, 63 and 24 plants were found to be infected by [$CYSDV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*].
In the case of [$cucumber#Plant*] samples, [$CYSDV#Virus*] and C[$YV#Disease*]V were detected on the 82 and 12 plants out of 110 [$cucumber plants#Plant*].
The collected [$whitefly#Virus*]-vector from the infected [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon plants#Plant*] were tested by [$PCR#Method*].
The assay showed that [$B.tabaci#Virus*] Biotype B (92%) efficiently transmits the viruses but Q biotype (8%) poorly transmitted the viruses.
The study of [$PCR#Method*] clearly pointed out that individual [$whitefly#Virus*] is a harbour of viruses and transmits the viruses.
DNA fragments were directly sequenced and compared with [$CYSDV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*] isolates with that of Israel, USA and Spain isolates.
It was concluded that 96% of [$CYSDV#Virus*] (AY580985, FJ492808) and 95% of C[$YV#Disease*]V isolates nucleotide identity with the [$coat protein gene#Gene*] with Israel, USA and Spanish isolates.
