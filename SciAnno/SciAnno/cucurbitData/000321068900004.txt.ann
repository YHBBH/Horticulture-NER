[@Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*] ([@syn.C.lagenarium#Virus*]) is the causal agent of [$anthracnose#Virus*] disease on [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
This [@fungus#Virus*] forms dome-shaped, melanized appressoria as a host invasion structure.
Strain 104-T (MAFF240422) of [$C.orbiculare#Virus*], which was originally isolated from a [$cucumber#Plant*] plant in 1951 by Dr.
Yasumori, Kyoto University, has proven to be an excellent experimental model for the study of fungal [$pathogen#Virus*]esis and morphogenesis because of its stable [$pathogenicity#Plant*] and synchronous infection-related morphogenesis.
This review considers the discoveries made during 60 years of study on [$C.orbiculare#Virus*].
In particular, we focus on advances made in the last two decades, which have provided a basis for the [$molecular analysis#Method*] not only of fungal morphogenesis, but also of plant-microbe interactions, including plant immunity to adapted and nonadapted [@Colletotrichum fungi#Virus*].
This substantial body of innovative research was originated by the Phytopathological Society of Japan and represents a major contribution to the international research communities working on plant pathology, plant-microbe interactions, and fungal molecular genetics.
This review deals with the past achievements and future prospects in the study of Colletorichum biology, focusing on the molecular genetics of [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] with regard to four aspects: (1) metabolic and functional development of infection structures, (2) signaling pathways required for fungal [$pathogen#Virus*]esis, (3) [$pathogen#Virus*]-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and host basal resistance, and (4) establishment of host specificity.
