[@Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB)#Disease*], caused by the seedborne, gram-negative bacterium [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], is a serious threat to [$cucurbit #Plant*]seed and fruit production worldwide.
Because of the lack of effective management strategies, we investigated the efficacy of a non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strain as a biological control seed treatment for [$BFB#Disease*].
For this study, we generated a type III secretion system mutant of [@A.citrulli#Virus*], [$AAC#Virus*]00-1 Delta hrcC, that was nonpathogenic on [$watermelon#Plant*] but retained its ability to colonize germinating [$watermelon#Plant*] seed.
With [$watermelon#Plant*] seed naturally infested with [$A.citrulli#Virus*], AAC00-1 Delta hrcC reduced [$BFB#Disease*] seedling transmission by 81.8% relative to control seed.
In comparison, another [$A.citrulli #Virus*]antagonist, A.avenae strain AAA 99-2, reduced [$BFB#Disease*] seedling transmission by 74.6% for seed samples from the same lot.
Additionally, when female [$watermelon#Plant*] blossoms were protected with AAC00-1 Delta hrcC and subsequently challenged with AAC00-1, the resulting seedlots displayed 8% [$BFB#Disease*] seedling transmission.
This was not significantly different than seed from blossoms protected with AAA 99-2 (4%) but significantly less than those from blossoms protected with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (36%).
These results suggest that non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic [$A.citrulli #Virus*]has potential as a biological control seed treatment component in a comprehensive [$BFB#Disease*] management program.
