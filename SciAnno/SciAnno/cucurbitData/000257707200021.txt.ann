[@Safflower seedlings#Plant*] were used to discriminate two morphologically similar species of [@Phytophthora#Virus*] namely [@P.melonis#Virus*] and [@P.drechsleri#Virus*].
All isolates of [$P.melonis#Virus*] from different sources could not infect [$safflower seed#Plant*]lings under high inoculum potential whereas all isolates of [$P.drechsleri#Virus*] from various hosts attacked safflower within a short period.
Of 31 authentic [$Phytophthora#Virus*] species inoculated to [@safflower seedlings#Plant*] only seven species including [@Phytophthora asparagi#Virus*], [@Phytophthora cactorum#Virus*], [@Phytophthora cryptogea#Virus*], [@Phytophthora drechsleri#Virus*], [@Phytophthora erythroseptica#Virus*], [$Phytophthora palmivora#Virus*] and [@Phytophthora quercina#Virus*] caused hypocotyls infection.
All [$cucurbit#Plant*] isolates of [$Phytophthora#Virus*] from different parts of Iran and one from China could not infect [$safflower seedlings#Plant*] and were identified as [$P.melonis#Virus*] which had been confirmed previously by [@molecular analysis#Method*].
