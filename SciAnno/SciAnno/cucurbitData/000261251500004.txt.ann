[@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] is a [$pathogen#Virus*] of several economically important [$crops#Plant*], including [$pepper#Plant*] ([$Capsicum annuum#Plant*]).
The [$pathogen#Virus*] attacks the roots, leaves.
sterns.
and fruits of the plant.
The variability among 37 strains of [$P capsici#Virus*] from individual fields in Shandong.
Anhui, and Fujian provinces in eastern China and 17 strains of [$P.capsici#Virus*] from other Countries was assessed by determining Virulence, mating type.
and genetic profile using [$random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis#Method*].
Five strains of [@Phytophthora nicotianae#Virus*] and two of [$Phytophthora#Virus*] infestans were also included in the [@RAPD analysis#Method*].
No strains with mating type A2 were detected in [$P.capsici#Virus*].
Variation Was found in the virulence assays based on [$pathogenicity#Plant*] to a set of nine [$pepper#Plant*] cultivar differentials.
where the strains from eastern China grouped into seven pathotypes.
[$RAPD analysis#Method*] of all 37 strains from eastern China using 12 primers resulted in 129 fragments, of which 74.4% were polymorphic, revealing the existence of different patterns among strains.
[$Cluster analysis#Method*] using, the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means separated the eastern China strains into two [$RAPD#Method*] groups.
and two non-Chinese strains clustered into group II.
Among, [$P.capsici#Virus*] strains derived from eastern China, no correlation was found between groups identified by [$RAPD analysis#Method*] and pathotype groups defined by virulence.
[$Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] was 36% similar to P infestans and only 20% similar to [@P.nicotianae#Virus*].
