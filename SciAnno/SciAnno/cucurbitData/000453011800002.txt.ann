A [@rapid, sensitive and visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method#Method*] for detecting [$Acidovorax citrulli#Plant*] in [$cucurbit #Plant*]seed was developed in this study.
The LAMP primers were designed to recognize the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene (locus tag: Aave_4658) from [$A.citrulli#Virus*].
The [$LAMP assay#Method*] was conducted at 64 degrees C in 1 hr with calcein as an indicator.
The sensitivity and specificity of the [$LAMP assay#Method*] were further compared with those of a conventional [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]).
The [$LAMP assay#Method*] is highly specific to [$A.citrulli#Virus*], and no cross-reaction was observed with other bacterial [$pathogen#Virus*].
The sensitivity of the [$LAMP assay#Method*] was 100-fold higher than that of conventional [$PCR#Method*] with a detection limit of 1 pg of genomic DNA.
Using the [$LAMP assay#Method*], 7 of 12 [$cantaloupe#Plant*] seedlots collected from Xinjiang province were determined to be positive for [$A.citrulli#Virus*].
In contrast, only 2 of 12 seedlots showed positive for the [$pathogen#Virus*] with conventional [$PCR#Method*].
Moreover, [$A.citrulli #Virus*]was detected in 100% of artificially [$infe#Plant*]sted seedlots with 0.01% [$infe#Plant*]station or greater.
Our results demonstrated that the [$LAMP assay#Method*] was simple, visual and sensitive for detecting [$A.citrulli#Virus*], especially in seed health testing.
Hence, this method has great potential application in routine detecting [$seed-borne pathogens #Virus*]and reducing the risk of epidemics.
