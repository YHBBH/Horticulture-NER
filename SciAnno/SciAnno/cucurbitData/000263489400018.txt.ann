Production of polyclonal antibodies requires large amount of purified virus that can be avoided by the use of recombinant [@coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]).
Recombinant [$CP#Gene*] of [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) was thus used for the production of polyclonal antibodies as the virus purification from [$papaya#Plant*] tissues provides low virus yields.
[$CP#Gene*] was expressed as a fusion protein (similar to 72 kD) containing a fragment of E.
coli maltose binding protein.
Polyclonal antibodies from rabbits immunized with the fusion protein, successfully detected natural infection of [$PRSV#Virus*] in [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] samples collected from different locations at 1:4000 dilution in direct antigen-coated [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*].
