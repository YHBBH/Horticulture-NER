[@Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) is one of the major viruses infecting [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide.
Although [$WMV#Virus*] is very common worldwide, little is known about the biological traits of [$WMV#Virus*] isolates from China.
Hence, this study aimed to characterize 11 [$WMV#Virus*] isolates infecting [$melon#Plant*] from different geographical origins in Xinjiang based on experimental hosts.
Sap inoculation of the 11 [$WMV#Virus*] isolates onto a range of 13 plant species revealed some differences compared to the [$WMV#Virus*] isolates collected from other countries.
Our results showed that, overall, there were no obvious correlations of host responses to inoculation with [$WMV#Virus*] isolates from different geographical origins.
However, isolate JS-1 caused mild mosaic on[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata, whereas the remaining 10 isolates were asymptomatic on this plant species.
Moreover, in [$Datura stramonium#Plant*], isolate TYG-1 induced mosaic, whereas the remaining 10 isolates did not infect this species.
All isolates infected systemically[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] and [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] plants, causing severe symptoms.
All isolates did not induce any symptoms on [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], but the virus could be detected [$using RT-PCR#Method*].
Additionally, all isolates infected systemically [$Nicotiana tabacum#Plant*] plants, causing mild mosaics.
[$Chenopodium amaranticolor#Plant*] and [$Chenopodium quinoa#Plant*] reacted to all isolates by chlorotic local lesions in the inoculated leaves, and the virus was detected in the inoculated leaves [$using RT-PCR#Method*].
In addition, the attempts to transmit the isolates to [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*], [$Vicia faba#Plant*], [$Phaseolus vulgaris#Plant*], [@Vigna unguiculata#Plant*] or [$Pisum sativum#Plant*] failed as confirmed by negative [$RT-PCR#Method*].
Our results would be useful for understanding the biological variability of [$WMV#Virus*].
