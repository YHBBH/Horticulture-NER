[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), an isolate of [$papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] infecting [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), and [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) were found infecting commercially grown [$cucurbits#Plant*] on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Maui, and Molokai during 1988 and 1989.
 Although previously reported in the Hawaiian Islands, [$watermelon mosaic virus 2#Virus*] ([$WMV-2#Virus*]) was not found.
 Composition of virus epidemics varied widely among the three islands, even though all three viruses, alternate [$weed hosts#Plant*], and aphid vectors are present throughout the state.
 Twenty-eight [$weed#Plant*] species were sampled.
 [$CMV#Virus*], [$PRSV-W#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*] infections were found in three species of the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*]:  Mormordica charantia ([$weed#Plant*]y form of bitter[$melon#Plant*]), [$Cucumis dipsaceus#Plant*] (wild [$cucumber#Plant*]), and [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] ([$bottle gourd#Plant*]).
 Although many of the [$weed#Plant*] species tested did not appear to serve as alternative virus hosts, aphid surveys demonstrated that many of the same [$weed#Plant*] species are alternate hosts for at least five important aphid vector species, including [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*] and [$Myzus persicae#Virus*].
 This information has implications for control of [$CMV#Virus*], [$PRSV-W#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*] in commercially grown [$cucurbits#Plant*].
