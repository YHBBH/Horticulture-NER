Introduction.
Knowledge of tephritid diversity in Senegal was poor before 2004, so PIP-COLEACP and CIRAD, in collaboration with Ceres-DPV, carried out, in 2004, trapping for preliminary detection of fruit flies in six orchards in the Niayes zone.
Materials and methods.
We selected three mixed [@mango#Plant*] orchards and three homogeneous [$mango#Plant*] orchards in this zone.
In each orchard, we used three attractants: Terpinyl acetate (Ter), Trimedlure (Tri) and Torula (Tor).
Traps were serviced weekly.
Results.
We captured 77 642 fruit flies in more than 4 months including [$mango#Plant*] season; they were represented by 18 identified fly species, including ten Ceratitis, six Dacus and two Bactrocera species.
Two very serious pests were identified with the confirmation of [$Bactrocera cucurbitae #Plant*]([$Coquillett#Virus*]) for [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] and the detection of B.invadens Drew Tsuruta & White for [$fruit crops#Plant*].
The two most abundant species of Ceratitis were [@C.cosyra#Plant*] and [@C.silvestrii#Plant*].
Discussion.
We captured more [$fruit fly#Plant*] species in mixed [$mango#Plant*] or[$chard#Plant*]s than in homogeneous [$mango#Plant*] orchards.
Bactrocera invadens was also more abundant in mixed orchards, probably because of its polyphagous status.
This new invasive species, B.invadens, can have many hosts in mixed [$mango#Plant*] orchards, enhancing its breeding potential.
Conclusion.
Effective management to deal with this alien species requires: (i) improvement of basic and applied research; (ii) an effective IPM package; (iii) an area-wide management approach; (iv) a sub-regional effort on the part of researchers, extension services, growers, exporters, farming associations and the different actors in fruit value chains (mainly [$mango#Plant*]).
