[@Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB)#Disease*], caused by the seedborne bacterium [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], is an economically important threat to [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*] worldwide.
Since the first report of [$BFB#Disease*] in Brazil in 1990, outbreaks have occurred sporadically on [$watermelon#Plant*] and, more frequently, on [$melon#Plant*], resulting in significant yield losses.
At present, the genetic diversity and the population structure of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains in Brazil remain unclear.
A collection of 74 [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains isolated from naturally infected tissues of different [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts in Brazil between 2000 and 2014 and 18 [$A.citrulli #Virus*]reference strains from other countries were compared by pulsed-field [$gel electrophoresis#Method*] (PFGE), multilocus [$sequence analysis#Method*] ([$MLSA#Method*]) of housekeeping and virulence-associated genes, and [$pathogenicity tests#Method*] on [$seedlings#Plant*] of different [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
The Brazilian population comprised predominantly group I strains (98%), regardless of the year of isolation, geographical region, or host.
Whole-genome restriction digestion and [$PFGE analysis #Method*]revealed that three unique and previously unreported [$A.citrulli #Virus*]haplotypes (assigned as haplotypes B22, B23, and B24) occurred in Brazil.
The greatest diversity of [$A.citrulli #Virus*](four haplotypes) was found among strains collected from the northeastern region of Brazil, which accounts for more than 90% of the country's [$melon#Plant*] production.
[$MLSA#Method*] clearly distinguished [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains into two well-supported clades, in agreement with observations based on PFGE analysis.
Five Brazilian [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains, representing different group I haplotypes, were moderately aggressive on [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] compared with four group II strains that were highly aggressive.
In contrast, no significant differences in [$BFB#Disease*] severity were observed between group I and II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]strains on [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*].
Finally, we observed a differential effect of temperature on in vitro growth of representative group I and II [$A.citrulli #Virus*]haplotypes.
Specifically, of 18 group II strains tested, all grew at 40 and 41 degrees C, whereas only 3 of 15 group I strains (haplotypes B8 [P], B3[K], and B15) grew at 40 degrees C.
Three strains representing haplotype B8 (P) were the only group I strains that grew at 41 degrees C.
These results contribute to a better understanding of the genetic diversity of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]associated with [$BFB#Disease*] outbreaks in Brazil, and reinforce the efficiency of [$MLSA#Method*] and [$PFGE analysis #Method*]for assessing population structure.
This study also provides the first evidence to suggest that temperature might be a driver in the ecological adaptation of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]populations.
