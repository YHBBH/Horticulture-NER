[@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] causes significant losses to [$vegetable#Plant*] production worldwide.
Pyrimorph, a new carboxylic acid amide fungicide, has been registered to control [@P.capsici#Virus*] in China.
A mutation (Q1077K) in cellulose synthase 3 has been reported to confer resistance to pyrimorph.
In this study, we measured the competition between pyrimorph-resistant and pyrimorph-sensitive isolates of [@P.capsici#Virus*].
Mixed zoospore suspensions of resistant (R) and sensitive (S) isolates at five ratios (1R:9S, 3R:7S, 5R:5S, 7R:3S, and 9R:1S) were applied to [$carrot#Plant*] agar in vitro test (with five successive transfers) and to the soil surface around [$pepper#Plant*] plants in planta test (with 10 successive disease cycles).
The proportion of resistant isolates was measured by a conventional assay in which single zoospore isolates recovered after transfers or disease cycles were grown on agar medium with a discriminatory concentration of pyrimorph.
The results were then compared with those of a [@real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method#Method*] developed here, the results were similar.
Both assays showed that the competitive ability of the resistant isolates was similar to or less than that of the sensitive isolates.
The [$real-time PCR assay #Method*]developed will be useful for high-throughput analysis and monitoring the development of pyrimorph resistance in field populations of [$P capsici#Virus*].
