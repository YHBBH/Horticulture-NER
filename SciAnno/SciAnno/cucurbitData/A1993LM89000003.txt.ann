The pathogenicity of [$Monosporascus cannonballus#Virus*] to nine [$cucurbit #Plant*]and eight non[$cucurbit species #Plant*]was evaluated in the greenhouse by [$direct seeding#Plant*] into infested soil.
Six of the [$cucurbit species #Plant*]were also tested under simulated field conditions in artificially infested mi[$crop#Plant*]lots.
In the greenhouse, [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] was isolated from 70-100% of the [$cucumber#Plant*], [$muskmelon#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] plants and from 33-70% of the [$bean#Plant*], [$corn#Plant*], [$sorghum#Plant*], and [$sugar beet#Plant*] plants 8-9 wk after planting.
Perithecia of the [$fungus#Virus*] were observed on the roots of all [$cucurbits#Plant*] tested but only rarely on roots of non[$cucurbits#Plant*].
Discrete brownish lesions, general light discoloration, and necrosis were characteristic symptoms of [$cucurbit #Plant*]root infection.
Consistent reductions in top dry weight were observed in [$wheat#Plant*], [$corn#Plant*], and all the [$cucurbits#Plant*] tested.
Screening of [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) cultigens indicated tolerance to [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] in two breeding lines and several cultivars.
In the microplots, typical vine decline symptoms were reproduced on [$muskmelon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] 9 wk after planting.
This report is the first to demonstrate pathogenicity of [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] to a wide range of [$cucurbits#Plant*] on the basis of greenhouse and microplot tests.
