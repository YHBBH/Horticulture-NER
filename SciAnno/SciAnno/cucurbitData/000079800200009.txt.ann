Vedic and early post-Vedic Sanskrit works describe Indo-Aryan life in northern India during 2000-200 B.C.
Wild and cultivated plants of the [$Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] played an important role in Indo-Aryan food, medicine, and culture: over 300 words describing [@curcurbits #Plant*]are found in the Sanskrit texts.
These words, their etymological relationships, and the geographies of the [$cucurbit#Plant*] taxa were compared.
Results indicate that the Indo-Aryas knew only a handful of [$curcurbits #Plant*]before entering the Indian subcontinent from the west.
They learned of at least 11 more species from their neighbors in India, who were speakers of Dravidian or Munda languages.
