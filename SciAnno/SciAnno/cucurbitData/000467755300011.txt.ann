Plant organ growth and development are determined by a subtle balance between growth stimulation and inhibition.
Fruit size and shape are important quality traits influencing yield and market value; however, the underlying mechanism regulating the balance of fruit growth to achieve final size and shape is not well understood.
Here, we report a mechanistic model that governs [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) fruit elongation through fine-tuning of ethylene homeostasis.
We identified a [$cucumber#Plant*] mutant that bears short fruits owing to repressed cell division.
SF1 (Short Fruit 1) encodes a [$cucurbit#Virus*]-specific RING-type E3 ligase, and the mutation resulted in its enhanced self-ubiquitination and degradation, but accumulation of [$ACS#Gene*]2 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2), a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis.
The overproduction of ethylene contributes to the short-fruit phenotype of sf1.
Dysfunction of [@ACS2#Gene*] resulted in reduced ethylene production, but still repressed cell division and shorter fruit, suggesting that ethylene is still required for basal fruit elongation.
SF1 ubiquitinates and degrades both itself and [$ACS2#Gene*] to control ethylene synthesis for dose-dependent effect on cell division and fruit elongation.
Our findings reveal the mechanism by which ethylene dosage is regulated for the control of cell division in developing fruit.
