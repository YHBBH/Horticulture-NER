Plant species display various mechanisms to cope with waterlogging.
However, little was known about [@ethylene response factors (ERF)#Gene*] group regulation in waterlogging response in [$cucumber#Plant*], which plays an important role in low oxygen tolerance in [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] ([@Arabidopsis thaliana L.#Plant*]) and [$rice#Plant*] ([@Oryza sativa L.#Plant*]), associated with waterlogging stress.
Three ERF group.
genes in [$cucumber#Plant*] were identified, named [@CsERF1#Gene*], [@CsERF2#Gene*] and [@CsERF3#Gene*], based on the information of differentially expressed genes in waterlogging tolerant line Zaoer-N root under waterlogging stress by digital gene expression profile and [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Database (htpp://www.icugi.org).
Previous research had shown that [$CsERF1#Gene*] was induced in the root of tolerant line Zaoer-N under waterlogging stress, while [$CsERF3#Gene*] was repressed, and no significant change was found in [$CsERF2#Gene*].
When pretreated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene perception, [$CsERF1#Gene*] was significantly down-regulated, but [$CsERF3#Gene*] was slightly up-regulated.
In the present study, a series of stagnant concentrations (deoxygenated 0, 0.05% and 0.10% Agar) was used to simulate the hypoxic environment and test the expression pattern of [$CsERF1#Gene*] and [$CsERF3#Gene*] at 4h and 12h after stagnant treatment.
The results suggested a key role of [$CsERF1#Gene*] in response to low oxygen and waterlogging stress in [$cucumber#Plant*].
