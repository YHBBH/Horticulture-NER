This study, [@using RT-PCR#Method*], is the first comprehensive assessment since 1991 of a generic detection method for the Luteoviridae.
Thirteen Luteoviridae species were detected using three separate sets of low-degeneracy generic primers with [$RT-PCR#Method*] to amplify 68-, 75- and 129/156-bp regions of the Luteoviridae coat-protein gene.
Species detected include all members of the [@genus Luteovirus#Virus*] [[@Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)-PAV#Virus*], [@BYDV-PAS#Virus*], [@BYDV-MAV#Virus*] (129 and/or 156 bp amplicons), [@Soybean dwarf virus#Virus*], [@Bean leafroll virus #Virus*](68 bp amplicon)] and eight of nine species from the [@genus Polerovirus#Virus*] [[$Beet western yellows virus#Virus*], [$Beet chlorosis virus#Virus*], [$Beet mild yellowing virus#Virus*], [$Turnip yellows virus#Virus*], [$Potato leafroll virus#Virus*], [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*], [@Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV#Virus*] (68-bp amplicon) and [@Sugarcane yellow leaf virus#Virus*] (75-bp amplicon)].
These primers were not able to detect [@Carrot red leaf virus#Virus*], [@Sweet potato leaf speckling virus#Virus*] (both belong to unassigned Luteoviridae) and [@Pea enation mosaic virus-1#Virus*] ([@genus Enamovirus#Virus*]).
A synthetic positive control containing all primer sequence priming sites was designed to facilitate this method as a generic tool for use with a variety of [$host plants#Plant*].
The Luteoviridae primers described in this study present a simple infection-detection tool of benefit to biosecurity authorities in nursery-stock surveillance, disease management or outbreak prevention, and may also be useful in detection of as-yet undiscovered species within the [$Luteovirus#Virus*] and [$Polerovirus#Virus*] genera.
