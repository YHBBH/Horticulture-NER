During the growing seasons 2014 and 2015, 134 [$cucumber#Plant*] and 103 [$weed#Plant*] samples showing typical [$yellowing disease#Disease*]s symptoms accompanied by chlorotic spots and interveinal chlorosis were collected from Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia.
For this reason, [$RT-PCR#Method*] was conducted for detection of two criniviruses, [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) which are implicated in [@cucurbit yellows disease#Disease*].
Results showed the presence of [$CCYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] samples in 61.1% and 19.4%, respectively, whereas 9% of the plants were contained mixed infection.
In addition, four [$weed#Plant*] species were identified, for the first time, as alternative hosts of [$CCYV#Virus*]; whereas [$CYSDV#Virus*] was reported only in Malva parviflora plants.
Partial nucleotide sequencing analysis was conducted using 13 [$CCYV#Virus*] and five of [$CYSDV#Virus*] isolates originated from [$cucumber#Plant*] and wild hosts.
Both viruses exhibited low genetic diversity; however, [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] clustered the obtained [$CYSDV#Virus*] isolates in a separated group, named the "Eastern subpopulation", while [$CCYV#Virus*] isolates were classified into subgroups IIa and IIb, among other published sequences, forming a different evolutionary lineage from group I, which contained an isolate from Iran.
