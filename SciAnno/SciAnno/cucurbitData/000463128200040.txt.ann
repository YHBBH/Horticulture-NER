Parthenocarpy, the natural or artificial induced fruit production without fertilization of ovules, confers various agricultural benefits, such as stable [$crop#Plant*] production in fluctuating environments, as well as increased fruit quality and shelf-life of some fleshy fruits.
Whereas, phytohormones are known as important mediators of the fertilization-independent fruiting.
Here, diploid parthenocarpic [$watermelon#Plant*] was produced by pollination with partially functional pollen, which was irradiated with soft-X-rays.
Ovule transcriptome analyses demonstrated both irradiated and normal pollen induced complex hormone-regulation during fruit-set, and quick response of auxin signaling and downstream network may be crucial for fruit-set.
Dynamic investigation of phytohormones in fertilized ovaries suggested soft-X-irradiated pollen induced the accumulation of gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs) and auxin as normal pollen did.
Exogenous application of hormones or inhibitors suggested auxin may specifically act in fruit-set, whereas GAs is insufficient to induce parthenocarpy but function in fruit-growth stage.
Single treatment of 1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU, an active CK) could induce parthenocarpic fruit-set and subsequent growth, which might partly dependent on induced auxin accumulation in fruits.
Our results will contribute to the potential breeding of vegetative (autonomous) parthenocarpic [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivar via genetic engineering, as well as provide useful insights into the mechanisms underlying parthenocarpy in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
