[@Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) is prevalent in different [$cucurbit#Plant*] growing agro-ecosystems in Sudan.
A study of the biological and serological variability of isolates originating from different regions was conducted to better understand [$ZYMV#Virus*] epidemiology and to develop adapted and durable control strategies.
Variability was detected among isolates regarding symptomatology, host range and virulence towards the Zym resistance gene in [@melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) PI 414723.
Serological variability was also revealed using a set of seven differential monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against a French isolate ([$ZYMV#Virus*]-E9).
Six serotypes were differentiated, but a majority of isolates (88%) reacted with all the mAbs as did the reference strains from Italy and France.
All isolates from Sudan were equally well controlled by the resistance genes described in [$squash#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita moschata (Duchesne) Duchesne ex Poir.cvs.Menina and Nigeria#Plant*]) and in [$cucumber#Plant*] ([@Cucumis sativus L.cv.TMG#Plant*]), or by cross protection with the mild [$ZYMV#Virus*]-WK strain.
All isolates were transmitted in a nonpersistent manner by [@Aphis gossypii Glover#Virus*] and [@Myzus persicae Sulzer#Virus*].
