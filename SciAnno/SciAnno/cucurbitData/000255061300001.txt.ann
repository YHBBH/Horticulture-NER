Taconomy: [@Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) is an [$aphid#Virus*]-transmitted plant virus belonging to the [$genus Potyvirus#Virus*], [$family Potyviridae#Virus*], with a positive sense RNA genome.
[$PRSV#Virus*] isolates belong to either one of two major strains, P or W.
The P strains infect both [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] whereas the W strains infect only [$cucurbits#Plant*].
   Geographical distribution: [@PRSV-P#Virus*] is found in all major [$papaya#Plant*]-growing areas.
   Physical porperties: Virions are filamentous, non-enveloped and flexuous measuring 760-800 x 12 nm.
Virus particles contain 94.5% protein and 5.5% nucleic acid.
The protein component consists of the virus [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]), which has a molecular weight of about 36 kDa as estimated by [$Western blot analysis#Method*].
Density of the sedimenting component in purified [$PRSV#Virus*] preparations is 1.32 g/cm(3) in CsCl.
   Genome: The [$PRSV#Virus*] genome consists of a unipartite linear single-stranded positive sense RNA of 10 326 nucleotides with a 5' terminus, genome-linked protein, VPg.
   Transmission: The virus is naturally transmitted via [$aphids#Virus*] in a non-persistent manner.
Both the [$CP#Gene*] and helper component ([$HC-Pro#Gene*]) are required for vector transmission.
This virus can also be transmitted mechanically, and is typically not seed-transmitted.
   Hosts: [$PRSV#Virus*] has a limited number of hosts belonging to the [@families Caricaceae#Plant*], [@Chenopodiaceae#Plant*] and [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
Propagation hosts are: [@Carica papaya#Plant*], [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] and [@Cucumis metuliferus#Plant*] cv.accession 2459.
Local lesion assay hosts are: [@Chenopodium quinoa#Plant*] and [@Chenopodium amaranticolor#Plant*].
   Control: Two transgenic [$papaya#Plant*] varieties, Rainbow and SunUp, with engineered resistance to [$PRSV#Virus*] have been commercially grown in Hawaii since 1998.
Besides transgenic resistance, tolerant varieties, cross-protection and other cultural practices such as isolation and rogueing of infected plants are used to manage the disease.
