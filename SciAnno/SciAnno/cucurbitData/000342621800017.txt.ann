[@Ipomoviruses#Virus*] ([$genus Ipomovirus#Virus*]) are [$whitefly-transmitted viruses#Virus*] assigned to the [$family Potyviridae#Virus*].
They are characterised by filamentous flexible particles and a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome.
The viral genome is translated into a polyprotein precursor, which is processed into mature proteins and a short overlapping open reading frame.
The [$genus Ipomovirus#Virus*] contains four accepted species and one unapproved species, and two other tentative members have recently been characterised.
[$Ipomoviruses#Virus*] cause serious economic losses in many important [$crops#Plant*], including [$cassava#Plant*], [$sweet potato#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*] and [@aubergine#Plant*].
These viruses are transmitted by [$whiteflies#Virus*] in a non-circulative, semi-persistent manner, the virions being retained on the external surface of the vectors' mouthparts for a few days or weeks.
Comparison of the available complete genome sequences of different ipomoviruses revealed differences in their genome organisation and a considerable variation in their proteins and conserved motifs that may reflect functional differences.
This review summarises the current knowledge of the members within the [$genus Ipomovirus#Virus*], focusing on genome organisation, taxonomic classification and the mechanism by which they are transmitted.
