The complete [$coat protein#Gene*] (cp) gene sequence of eighty [$Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus#Virus*]-[[$potato#Plant*]] ([$ToLCNDV#Virus*]-[[$potato#Plant*]]) isolates collected from eleven states were determined.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] based on cp gene grouped the isolates into two major clades (I & II) and they shared 95.9-100.0% identity.
The DNA A and DNA B of eight representative isolates (six from clade I and two from clade II) were 2739-2740 and 2692-2694 nts long and shared 94.6-99.4% and 97.2-99.5% homology within the isolates, respectively.
Among the eight isolates, the DNA A of two isolates (Clade II), GWA-5 and FAI-19 had 94.6-95.3% sequence identity to other six isolates and formed a subclade within the [$ToLCNDV#Virus*]-[[$potato#Plant*]] isolates.
Similar grouping was also revealed with AC1 and AC4 genes of these eight isolates.
The DNA A components shared more than 90.0% identity with the DNA A of [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] isolates from [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*], bhendi, 89.0-90.0% with [$ToLCNDV#Virus*]-[$papaya#Plant*] isolates and 70.4-74.0% with other [$tomato#Plant*] leaf curl viruses.
Hence, the [$begomovirus#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]cting [$potatoes#Plant*] are the [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] isolates, designated as [$ToLCNDV#Virus*]-[[$potato#Plant*]].
Whereas, the DNA B components shared 86.6-91.7% identity with [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] isolates from [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*] and bhendi.
Evidence for intra-species recombination was detected only in DNA A with a maximum of three events in GWA-5 and FAI-19 isolates.
Analysis of cp gene, DNA A, iterons and recombination events clearly indicate that two groups of [$ToLCNDV#Virus*]-[[$potato#Plant*]] infects [$potato#Plant*] in India.
