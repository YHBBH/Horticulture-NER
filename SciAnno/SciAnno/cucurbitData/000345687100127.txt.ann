[@Virus diseases#Disease*] are very destructive especially on [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]), which is grown for seeds in Konya province, therefore this research was conducted in order to determine the virus infections in major [$cucurbit #Plant*]growing areas in Konya province.
In total, 423 plant samples with common symptoms of virus infections like mosaic, inward curling, blistering, mottling, distortion, shoestring, stunting and vine decline were collected from [$squash#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$snake melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*] plants during 2009 and 2010.
The viruses were identified by [$DAS-ELISA#Method*] and the results showed that 86.5% of plant samples were infected with [$Zucchini yellow mosaic Potyvirus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic Potyvirus#Virus*]-2 ([$WMV-2#Virus*]), [$Cucumber#Plant*] mosaic [$Cucumovirus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot Potyvirus-watermelon strain#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) or [@Squash mosaic#Plant*] [$Comovirus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]).
[$ZYMV#Virus*] was predominant (55.1%) in the research area and occurred in [$squash#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$snake melon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber plants#Plant*].
[$WMV-2#Virus*] was detected in [$snake melon#Plant*] at the ratio of 75% and it was followed by [$pumpkin#Plant*] (51.5%), [$watermelon#Plant*] (46.7%), [$squash #Plant*](45.4%), [$melon#Plant*] (39.1%) and [$cucumber#Plant*] (20%).
Also mixed infections were common in [$squash#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*].
[$Cucumber#Plant*] green mottle mosaic [$Tobamovirus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) was not present in the research area.
