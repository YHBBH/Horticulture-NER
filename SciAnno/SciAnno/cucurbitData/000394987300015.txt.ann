[@Cucurbit viruses#Virus*] have been associated with important economic losses in Xinjiang of China.
Therefore, a comprehensive survey and sample collection was performed during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons from the major [$melon#Plant*]-growing locations in Xinjiang which is the largest area for [$melon#Plant*] production in China.
Samples were analyzed using [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) to detect [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [$Tomato ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$ToRSV#Virus*]), [$Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MWMV#Virus*]), [$Tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$TSWV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] ([$WSMoV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), and [$Zucchini yellow fleck virus#Virus*] ([$ZYFV#Virus*]).
We collected 492 [$melon#Plant*] samples with virus-like symptoms.
Out of these, 94.5 % of the samples were infected by at least one of these viruses.
[$WMV#Virus*] was the most prevalent virus detected.
[$WMV#Virus*], [$CMV#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*] were detected in 77.0 %, 60.0 %, and 41.1 % of infected samples, respectively, and the infection rate of these three viruses changed significantly among [$melon cultivars#Plant*].
Other viruses analysed were not detected in any sample tested.
The number of multiple infections was high (average 57.2 %), with the most common double infection [$WMV#Virus*] + [$CMV#Virus*] (17.8 %), closely followed by [$WMV#Virus*] + [$ZYMV#Virus*] (14.4 %).
Statistical analysis of the potential association among viruses showed that there was a strong association between several viruses for multiple infections.
An analysis of [$WMV#Virus*] genetic diversity suggested that all isolates obtained in this study clustered into group A and that purifying selection was restricting variability in the population.
