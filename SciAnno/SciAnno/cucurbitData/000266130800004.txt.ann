During the 2007 growing season, [@melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) samples from the state of Guerrero in Mexico showing mosaie and other virus-like symptoms were collected for analysis.
Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained leaf-dip extracts revealed the presence of abundant virus-like particles with features characteristic of the [@family Bunyavirdiae#Virus*].
No other viral particles were observed in these preparations.
However, [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*]s ([$ELISA#Method*]s) specific for the most common [@Tospovirus spp.#Virus*]
gave negative results.
Antibodies raised against purified nucleocapsids reacted specifically with the infected leaf extracts in [$Western blot#Method*]s and [@double-antibody sandwich ELISA#Method*].
The viral RNA was used as a template for a cDNA library, and [$nucleotide sequence analysis#Method*] identified cloned cDNAs representing sequences corresponding to the three [$Tospovirus#Virus*] genome segments.
Sequence comparisons showed that the new virus had the highest similarity of [@Chrysanthemum stem necrosis virus#Virus*] ([@CSNV#Virus*]).
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of two genome regions confirmed that this virus, provisionally named [@Melon severe mosaie virus#Virus*] ([@MeSMV#Virus*]), is a previously undescribed [@Tospovirus sp.#Virus*]
belonging to the "new world" clade of [@Tospovirus spp.#Virus*]
An initial survey of various [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in various states of Mexico confirmed the widespread occurrence of this virus.
