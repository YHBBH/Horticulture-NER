[@Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm#Virus*] [[$anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum#Virus*] (Fr.) Sacc.], the plant [$pathogen#Virus*]ic [$fungus#Virus*] that causes [@gummy stem blight and black rot on cucurbits#Disease*], was first described in 1869 from [$Bryonia#Plant*] ([@bryony#Plant*] or [@wild hops#Plant*]) in central Europe.
Today, this [$pathogen#Virus*] is found on six continents on at least 12 genera and 23 species of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
How did [@D.bryoniae#Virus*] progress from a [$pathogen#Virus*] of a native plant in central Europe to a worldwide threat to [$cucurbits#Plant*] cultivated in humid environments? Clues from the early discoveries of this [$fungus#Virus*], its characteristics as a seedborne [$pathogen#Virus*], and its broad adaptation to [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts will provide some answers to this question.
