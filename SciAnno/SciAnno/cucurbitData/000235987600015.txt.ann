A survey of the incidence of yellowing viruses in Greek glasshouse (and occasional field) [@cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon crops#Plant*] was carried out during 2000-03.
In most cases disease incidence ranged from 50 to 80%.
Simplex [$RT-PCR#Method*] was used for the detection of [$Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), and [$DAS-ELISA#Method*] for the detection of [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]).
The results showed that [$BPYV#Virus*] was the predominant virus in [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon crops#Plant*], whereas [$CYSDV#Virus*], reported for first time in Greece, was isolated only in three regions of southern Greece: Rhodes, Crete and Arkadia.
[$CABYV#Virus*] was detected only in three [$cucumber#Plant*] glasshouses in Pella (Macedonia).
[@A simplified triplex RT-PCR method using a simple sample-preparation protocol#Method*] was developed to allow rapid, sensitive and simultaneous detection of the three viruses.
Sequence comparisons of the [$PCR#Method*] products of [$BPYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] revealed 98.7 and 100% amino acid identity, respectively, with previously reported sequences.
The arable [$weed#Plant*] species [@Amaranthus retroflexus#Plant*], [@Selosia cristata#Plant*], [@Sonchus oleraceus#Plant*] and [@Sonchus sp.#Plant*]
were identified as potential [$BPYV#Virus*] reservoirs.
