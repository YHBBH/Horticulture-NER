The [@combinational analysis of polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis#Method*] ([@PCR-RE#Method*]) to distinguish six [$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([$TYLCV#Virus*]) isolates from five countries was developed.
[$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] has spread from the Middle East to Western Europe, Central America and Eastern Asia, and occurs on infected [$crops#Plant*] such as[$ tomatoes#Plant*], [$peppers#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$beans#Plant*].
[$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] isolates from Jordan ([@TYLCV-Mld[Jo:Cuc#Virus*]] and [$TYLCV-IL#Virus*][[@Jo:Cuc]#Virus*]), Israel ([@TYLCV-IL[IL:Reo:86#Virus*]]), Spain ([@TYLCV-Mld[ES72/97]#Virus*]), USA ([@TYLCV-IL[US:F10:04]#Virus*]) and Korea ([@TYLCV-KR#Virus*]) were collected, and the sequences of the six isolates were analysed to distinguish them by [@PCR-RE combination analysis#Method*].
Oligonucleotide primers for the six [$TYLCV#Virus*] isolates were designed to amplify approximately 740 base pairs including the intergenic region (IR) and parts of V1 and V2 ORF.
Unique restriction enzyme sites were analysed to identify isolate-specific restriction enzyme sites on the [$PCR#Method*] products of each isolate.
Three enzymes (DdeI, FauI and BssSI) were selected by in silico analysis, and then, the [$PCR#Method*] products following the serial digestion of each restriction enzyme were separated by [$agarose gel electrophoresis#Method*] to distinguish the [$TYLCV#Virus*] isolates.
Taken together, the [$PCR-RE combination analysis#Method*] by serial digestion with three restriction enzymes could be a useful method for distinguishing the six isolates.
