BACKGROUND: [@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) is a cosmopolitan viral disease transmitted by [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] that infects [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
[$Cantaloupe#Plant*] production in the southwestern USA has been confronted by epidemics of [$CYSDV#Virus*] since 2006 when itwas first identified inArizona and California.
As a phloem-limited virus that is vectored in a semi-persistent manner by [$B.tabaci#Virus*], [$CYSDV#Virus*] has transmission characteristics thatmay be suppressed by select insecticide applications.
   RESULTS: Eight active ingredients formulated as foliar and/or soil-applied insecticideswere tested to determine the suppressive effect on transmission and incidence of [$CYSDV#Virus*] in greenhouse and field studies.
Many compounds limited virus transmission to <10% infected plants even when challenged by 30 viruliferous [$whiteflies#Virus*].
Foliar formulations had greater knockdown activity than their soil-applied analogs and resulted in lower virus transmission.
Insecticides that had the greatest effect on reducing virus transmission in the greenhouse also showed the lowest incidence of [$CYSDV#Virus*] in field trials.
   CONCLUSIONS: Select insecticides can significantly reduce transmission of [$CYSDV#Virus*].
However, insecticidemanagement of [$CYSDV#Virus*] incidence in [$cantaloupes#Plant*] has limitations in chronically high infestation areas such as the southwestern USA, and is often only able to delay disease onset rather than prevent its occurrence.
