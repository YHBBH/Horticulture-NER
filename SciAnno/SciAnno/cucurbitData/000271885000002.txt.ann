[@Winter squash#Plant*] and [@pumpkins#Plant*] are two of the most important [$Cucurbit#Plant*] [$vegetable crops#Plant*] in Turkey.
In this study, variation in seed phenotypes in 160 populations of [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*], collected from different regions of Turkey, was determined.
The present collection showed appreciable genotypic variation in seed shape, colour, brightness, seed dimensions, and seed weight.
Seeds displaying a wide elliptic shape (62.5%) were the most common in the collection.
Most populations displayed a cream seed colour (46.9%), followed by white (25.6%), brown (20.0%), and tawny (7.5%).
This study demonstrated that substantial differences in seed dimensions exist in Turkish [$winter squash#Plant*] populations.
Seed length ranged from 15.0 to 25.7 mm, 7.6-15.5 mm for seed width, and 1.4-6.1 mm for seed thickness.
For seed length to thickness ratio and seed width to thickness ratio, populations showed a range of 3.2-14.2 and 2.2-8.5, respectively.
Data were analysed [@using principal component analysis (PCA)#Method*].
PCA revealed that the first two PC axes explained 67.0% of the total multivariate variation.
This evaluation of seed trait variability can assist geneticists and breeders to identify the populations with unique characteristics for inclusion in future breeding activities.
