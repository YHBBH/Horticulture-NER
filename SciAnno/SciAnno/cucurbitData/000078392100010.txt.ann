AB A total of 106 isolates of [@Fusarium oxysporum#Virus*] obtained from diseased [$cucumber#Plant*] plants showing typical root and stem rot or [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] symptoms were characterized by pathogenicity, vegetative compatibility, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).
Twelve isolates of other formae speciales and races of [@F: oxysporum#Virus*] from [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts, three avirulent isolates of [$F: oxysporum#Virus*], and four isolates of [@Fusarium spp#Virus*].
obtained from [$cucumber#Plant*] were included for comparison.
Of the 106 isolates of [@F.oxysporum #Virus*]from [$cucumber#Plant*], 68 were identified by pathogenicity as [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.sp.
radicis-cucumerinum, 32 as [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
cucumerinum, and 6 were avirulent on [$cucumber#Plant*].
Isolates of [@F.oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
radicis-cucumerinum were vegetatively incompatible with [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
cucumerinum and the other [@Fusarium#Virus*] isolates tested.
A total of 60 isolates of [@F.oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp, radicis-cucumerinum was assigned to vegetative compatibility group (VCG) 0260 and 5 to VCG 0261, while 3 were vegetatively compatible with isolates in both VCGs 0260 and 0261 (bridging isolates).
All 68 isolates of [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
radicis-cucumerinum belonged to a single RAPD group.
A total of 32 isolates of [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
cucumerinum was assigned to eight different VCGs and two different RAPD groups, while 2 isolates were vegetatively self-incompatible.
Pathogenicity, vegetative compatibility, and RAPD were effective in distinguishing isolates of [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
radicis-cucumerinum from those of [$F: oxysporum#Virus*] f.
sp.
cucumerinum.
Parsimony and bootstrap analysis of the RAPD data placed each of the two formae speciales into a different phylogenetic [$bran#Plant*]ch.
