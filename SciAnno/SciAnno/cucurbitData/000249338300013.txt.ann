The occurrence and relative incidence of viruses including [@Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*]([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), and [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), [@kyuri green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$KGMMV#Virus*]), and [$Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]) were surveyed from main [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) production areas in Jeonnam province during 2000-2002.
[@Virus disease#Disease*] incidences of [$melon#Plant*] cultivating fields were 0% and 11% in spring and fall 2000; 40%, 2.1%, and 8.8% in spring, summer, and fall 2001; and 6.3% in spring 2002 in main cultivated areas in Jeonnam province, respectively.
Field disease incidences of [$melon#Plant*] virus infections were 0% and 18.8% in spring and fall 2000; 50%, 38.5%, and 82.6% in spring, summer, and fall 2001; and 47.4% in spring 2002, respectively.
Total of 101 [$melon#Plant*] samples showing typical disease symptoms were collected from 2000 to 2002 and tested for virus infection by [$RT-PCR#Method*].
[$Potyvirus#Virus*]-specific DNA fragments for [$WMV#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*], and [$PRSV#Virus*] were amplified from 46, 5, and 4 samples, respectively.
[$MNSV#Virus*] specific DNA.
fragment was amplified from 18 samples.
[$CMV#Virus*]-specific DNA fragment was detected from only 3 samples.
