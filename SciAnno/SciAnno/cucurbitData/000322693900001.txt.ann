[@Cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) and [$melon#Plant*] ([$C.melo L.#Plant*]) are globally important [$crop#Plant*] species in the family [$cucurbit#Plant*].
However, pests and disease, including various viral diseases, affect [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] production in Japan.
Choosing a resistant cultivar is one of the most effective methods for disease control.
Many sources of viral resistance have been identified in [$cucurbits#Plant*], and various resistant commercial cultivars have been bred.
This review describes the present status of [$cucurbit #Plant*]breeding and sources of resistance to the four major viruses in Japan.
[$Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([$MYSV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) are devastating insect-transmitted viruses that were first reported in Japan.
[$MYSV#Virus*]-resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$CCYV#Virus*]-resistant [$melon#Plant*] were selected from germplasm collections.
The resistance of [$cucumber#Plant*] accession 27028930 to [$MYSV#Virus*] is temperature dependent and intermediate; [$melon#Plant*] isolate ([$MYSV-S#Virus*]) inoculation resulted in no systemic infection of resistant [$cucumber plants#Plant*] at low temperature (20 degrees C).
The [$melon#Plant*] accession JP 138332 exhibits high resistance to [$CCYV#Virus*].
These accessions are considered promising sources for breeding resistant cultivars.
[$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) and [$Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]) are soil-borne viruses.
The Korean [$melon#Plant*] accession 'Chang Bougi' is resistant to the SH isolate of [$CGMMV#Virus*].
The resistance of 'Chang Bougi' is controlled by two independent complementary recessive genes (cgmmv-1 and cgmmv-2), whereas resistance to [$MNSV#Virus*] is controlled by a single recessive gene (nsv) in [$melon#Plant*].
The nsv gene was introduced into commercial cultivars, and these cultivars have shown high resistance to [$MNSV#Virus*].
There is an increasing demand for new cultivars with resistance to additional viruses.
To satisfy this demand and solve problems related to [$cucurbit viruses#Virus*], core collections of each [$cucurbit #Plant*][$crop#Plant*] are required for the identification of resistant germplasm, and marker-assisted selection will allow us to breed new cultivars rapidly and accurately.
