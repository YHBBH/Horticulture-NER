Breeding [@cucurbits#Plant*] for resistance to [$powdery mildew#Disease*] reguires a good knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of the causal [@fungal pathogens#Virus*] - [@Erysiphe cichoracearum DC.ex Merat#Virus*] and [@Sphaerotheca fuliginea/Schlecht.
ex Fr./Pollacci#Virus*].
Differences in their biology determine the need different sources of resistance and different means of the chemical treatment of cultures during growth.
[@S.fuliginea#Virus*] is typical for warmer climatic areas of the temperate zone and in protected cultures and has been frequent or even predominant in many parts of the world during the last decade.
The occurrence off.cichoracearum is more limited.
The aim of this study was to identify the occurrence of both [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] on [$cucurbits#Plant*] in different regions of the Czech Republic and to compare their distribution with regard to global tendences.
In 1995, 166 samples of [$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] and [@C.maxima#Plant*] leaves showing symptoms of [$powdery mildew#Disease*] were collected in 30 field locations in the Czech Republic.
The identification of both species was conducted by examination of the morphological characters of their imperfect (conidial) stage using a [@light-microscope#Method*], [@E.cichoracearum#Virus*] was found in all samples.
The mixture of both [$pathogens#Virus*] was detected at nine of the 30 locations.[$S.fuliginea#Virus*] was common predominantely in the cooler northern parts of the country, but it did not occur in the warmest regions of South Moravia.
There, throughout the growing period, [$E.cichoracearum#Virus*] was not replaced by [$S.fuliginea#Virus*].
The appearance of [$S.fuliginea#Virus*] in several northern regions can be explained by possible [$mycelium#Virus*] surviving in glasshouses, but is its absence in the South under comparable conditions is difficult to explain.
The distribution of both [$pathogens#Virus*] seems to be different from the situation reported for Western Europe and other similar climatic areas of the world.
These results highlight the importance of both [$pathogens#Virus*] in the Czech Republic and should be taken in consideration during [$Cucurbita#Plant*] breeding and disease resistance research.
