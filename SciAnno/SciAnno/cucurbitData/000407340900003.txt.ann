Sexual reproduction in the plant parasite [$Phytophthora capsici Leonian#Virus*] requires the interaction of two distinct mating types, A1 and A2.
Co-occurrence of these mating types can enhance the genetic diversity of [@P.capsici#Virus*] and alter its virulence or resistance characteristics.
Using an intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) screen of microsatellite diversity, we identified, cloned, and sequenced a novel 1121-base pair (bp) fragment specific to the A1 mating type of [@P.capsici#Virus*].
Primers Pcap-1 and Pcap-2 were designed from this DNA fragment to specifically detect the A1 mating type.
[@Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using these primers#Method*] amplified an expected 997-bp fragment from known A1 mating types, but yielded a 508-bp fragment from known A2 mating types.
This [@PCR-based assay#Method*] could be adapted to accurately and rapidly detect the co-occurrence of A1 and A2 [@P.capsici#Virus*] mating types from field material.
