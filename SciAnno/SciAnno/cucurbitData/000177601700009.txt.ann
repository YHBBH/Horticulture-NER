[@Didymella bryoniae#Virus*] ([$anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum#Virus*]) is the causal agent of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*], although other [$Phoma#Virus*] species are often isolated from [$cucurbit#Plant*] plants exhibiting symptoms of the disease.
The molecular and phylogenetic relationships between [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] and these [$Phoma#Virus*] species are unknown.
Isolates of [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] and [$Phoma#Virus*] obtained from [$cucurbits#Plant*] grown at various geographical locations in the United States were subjected to [$random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis#Method*] and [$internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis (ITS-I and ITS-2)#Method*] to determine the molecular and phylogenetic relationships within and between these fungi.
Using [$RAPD fingerprinting#Method*], 59 isolates were placed into four phylogenetic groups, designated RAPD group (RG) 1, RG 11, RG 111, and RG IV.
[$D.bryoniae#Virus*] isolates clustered in either RG 1 (33 isolates), RG 11 (12 isolates), or RG IV (one isolate), whereas all 13 [$Phoma#Virus*] isolates clustered to RG III.
There was greater than 99% sequence identity in the ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions between isolates in RG I and RG 11, whereas isolates in RG 111, [$P.medicaginis#Virus*] ATCC 6448 1, and R exigua ATCC 14728 clustered separately.
On [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*], a subset of RG I isolates were highly virulent (mean disease severity was 71%), RG 11 and RG IV isolates were slightly virulent (mean disease severity was 4%), and RG III isolates were non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic (disease severity was 0% for all isolates).
The ITS sequences indicate that RG I and RG 11 are both [$D.bryoniae#Virus*], but [@RAPD fingerprints#Method*] and [$pathogenicity#Method*] indicate that they represent two different molecular and virulence subgroups.
