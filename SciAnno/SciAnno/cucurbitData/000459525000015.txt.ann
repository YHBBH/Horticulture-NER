The influence of environmental and management factors on the occurrence of [$foliar pathogen#Virus*]s of [$watermelon#Plant*] was analyzed using survey-sampling data collected from commercial farms in South Carolina in spring 2015 and spring and fall 2016.
A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used to sample symptomatic [$watermelon#Plant*] leaves from 56 fields of 27 growers in seven counties representing the main [$watermelon#Plant*]-producing areas in the state.
In the sampling design, counties corresponded to strata, growers to first-stage clusters, and fields to second-stage clusters.
Pathogens were identified on 100 leaves collected per field based on reproductive structures that formed on the leaves.
Information about previous [$crops#Plant*], fruit type, field size, transplanting date, first harvest date, and fungicides applied within 7 days and within 7 to 14 days prior to sampling was obtained from growers.
Field alignment was determined with a compass.
Survey-specific logistic regression procedures were used to analyze the effect of these factors on the probabilities of [$pathogen#Virus*] occurrence.
Five [$fungal pathogens#Virus*], [$Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*], [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*], [$Cercospora citrullina#Virus*], [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], and [@Myrothecium sensu lato (s.l.)#Virus*], and the [@oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] were included in the analyses.
Among the factors we analyzed, there was a consistent increased probability of occurrence of [@Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*]
in fields with a previous [$cucurbit crop#Plant*], increasing probabilities of [$pathogen#Virus*] occurrence with increasing plant age, a lower probability of occurrence of some [$pathogens#Virus*] on triploid cultivars compared with diploid cultivars, and a decrease in probability of [$pathogen#Virus*] occurrence in fields aligned toward southwest or west.
Application of fungicides significantly reduced the probability of observing [$C.citrullina#Virus*], [$P.cubensis#Virus*], and [@Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*]
in 2015 and [@P.xanthii#Virus*] in spring 2016.
This study emphasizes the importance of [$crop#Plant*] rotation and fungicide applications to manage [$foliar diseases#Disease*] of [$watermelon#Plant*], particularly [$gummy stem blight#Disease*],[$ powdery mildew#Virus*], and [$downy mildew#Virus*].
Crop age, cultivar type, and field alignment also were found to significantly influence the probability of [$pathogen#Virus*] occurrence.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining the influence of various factors on [$foliar pathogen#Virus*]s of [$watermelon#Plant*] with data collected from commercial fields.
