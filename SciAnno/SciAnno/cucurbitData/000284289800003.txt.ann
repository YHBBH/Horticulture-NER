Variation among 17 accessions of [@Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] from different geographic regions and interspecific relationships of six taxa of [$Citrullus#Plant*] and [$Praecitrullus#Plant*] were studied: using electrophoretic patterns of their seed storage proteins.
Globulins, the salt soluble proteins, represented the major fraction with their proportion varying between 56.6% and 67.0%.
These were followed by albumins (16.6-20.8%) and glutelins (13.5-18.5%) with prolamins as the lowest (2.2-4.1%) of the four fractions.
[@Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis#Method*] under nonreducing conditions in the first dimension and reducing conditions in the second revealed disulphide-bonded subunit pairs of molecular weight 53, 52, 50 and 41 kDa, unlike the single subunit pair generally reported in different [$cucurbits#Plant*], each consisting of a large and a small subunit.
In the UPGMA dendrogram based on polypeptide patterns, the occurrence of [$C.lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*], [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] and [$C.lanatus#Plant*] accession PI 482318 in one subcluster suggested that phylogenetically [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] and [$C.lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*] are closely related.
The recently described annual wild species, [$Citrullus rehmii#Plant*], occurred independently nearest to the subcluster of these cultivated and wild taxa.
[$Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*], the perennial wild species occurred farther from this cluster showing relatively more genetic distance from the [$watermelons#Plant*].
[$Praecitrullus fistulosus#Plant*] was outclustered and appeared genetically distant from all the [$Citrullus#Plant*] taxa; this supported its placement in a separate genus unlike its nomenclature as a botanical variety of [$watermelon#Plant*] or as a separate species of [$Citrullus#Plant*] proposed in certain earlier studies.
