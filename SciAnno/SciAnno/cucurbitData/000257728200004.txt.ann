Most strains of [@Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) belong to type W, causing severe loss on [$cucurbits#Plant*] worldwide, or type P, devastating [$papaya#Plant*] in tropical areas.
While the host range of [@PRSV W#Virus*] is limited to plants of the families [$Chenopodiaceae#Plant*] and [@Cucuribitaceae#Plant*], [@PRSV P#Virus*], in addition, infects plants of the [@family Caricaceae#Plant*] ([@papaya family#Plant*]).
To investigate one or more viral genetic determinants for [$papaya#Plant*] infection, recombinant viruses were constructed between [$PRSV P#Virus*]-YK and [$PRSV W#Virus*]-Cl.
Host reactions to recombinant viruses indicated that the viral genomic region covering the C-terminal region (142 residues) of NIaVPg, full NIaPro, and N-terminal region (18 residues) of NIb, is critical for [$papaya#Plant*] infection.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] of this region revealed residue variations at position 176 of NIaVPg and positions 27 and 205 of NIaPro between type P and W viruses.
Host reactions to the constructed mutants indicated that the amino acid Lys(27) of NIaPro determines the host-specificity of [$PRSV#Virus*] for [$papaya#Plant*] infection.
Predicted three-dimensional structures of NIaPros of parental viruses suggested that Lys(27) does not affect the protease activity of NIaPro.
Recovery of the infected plants from certain [$papaya#Plant*]-infecting mutants implied involvement of other viral factors for enhancing virulence and adaptation of [$PRSV#Virus*] on [$papaya#Plant*].
