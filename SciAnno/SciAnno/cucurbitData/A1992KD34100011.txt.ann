Since 1988, a [$yellowing disease #Disease*]of [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$zucchini squash#Plant*] has been frequently observed in summer and autumn [$crops#Plant*] in France.
Infected plants show yellowing and thickening of the older leaves; symptom intensity differs depending upon cultivar and season, and can be easily overlooked when plants are already infected by mosaic-inducing viruses or other [$pathogens#Virus*].
The disease is associated with the presence of a virus with spherical particles c.
25 nm in diameter, which is readily transmitted in a persistent manner by the [$aphids#Virus*] [$Myzus persicae#Virus*] and [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*], but not mechanically.
Serological analysis, nucleic-acid-hybridization experiments and host-range studies indicate that the virus is distantly related to, but distinct from, [@beet western yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BWYV#Virus*]).
We propose to name this virus [$cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), and to consider it as a tentative new member of the [$luteovirus#Virus*] group.
[$CABYV#Virus*] was found to reduce significantly the yields of [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] by decreasing the number of fruit per plant but not by altering the fruit shape or quality.
Preliminary investigations of the [$epidemiology#Method*] of [$CABYV#Virus*] indicate that the virus is common in [$weeds#Plant*] and in cultivated [$cucurbits#Plant*].
[$CABYV#Virus*] was frequently detected in various regions of France, suggesting that it is one of the most prevalent viruses infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in this country.
