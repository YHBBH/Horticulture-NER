[@Generation and screening for nonpathogenic mutants#Method*] is a popular tool for identifying pathogenicity-related genes.
Successful application of this technique for plant fungal pathosystems requires reliable and rapid screening procedures.
This study reports on the development of a rapid in vitro bioassay enabling large-scale screening and isolation of non[$pathogen#Virus*]ic mutants of [$Colletotrichum gloeosporioides#Virus*] and [@C.acutatum#Plant*] on [$strawberry#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*].
Inoculation was carried out on [$strawberry#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] at two different developmental stages: 12-week-old (young) and 15-week-old (older) [$seedlings#Plant*].
A comparison was made between two inoculation techniques, (i) foliar dip and (ii) root soak, at two incubation temperatures (19 and 25degreesC).
Mortality of young [$seedlings#Plant*] was observed 4 days after inoculation with both species, reaching 50% within 10 days, using both techniques at 25degreesC.
However, mortality of older [$seedlings#Plant*] was delayed by 4 days compared with that in the young [$seedlings#Plant*] when using the root-soak method.
Disease development decreased in young and older [$seedlings#Plant*] at the lower temperature.
This method also was reliable in determining [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of the [$cucurbit#Plant*]-specific [$C.magna#Virus*] that did not cause disease symptoms on [$strawberry#Plant*] by either inoculation method.
The proposed method enabled screening of more than 980 restriction enzyme-mediated integration mutants resulting in a selection of five reduced-virulence isolates.
Initial characterization of some of these mutants revealed large differences in germination and appressorial formation compared with [$pathogen#Virus*]ic isolates.
