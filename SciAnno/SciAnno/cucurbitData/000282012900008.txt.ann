A putative [@Potexvirus#Virus*] was detected from [@bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) showing mosaic and mottle symptoms in Myanmar in 2007.
The virus was designated [@Lagenaria mild mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@LaMMoV#Virus*]) and was further characterized.
In artificial inoculation tests, infectivity of [$LaMMoV#Virus*] was limited to two families: [$Chenopodiaceae#Plant*] and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae.
The host range of [$LaMMoV#Virus*] differs from those of the two [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting potexviruses, [@Alternanthera mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@AltMV#Virus*]) and [@Papaya mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@PapMV#Virus*]).
Sequence analyses of [$LaMMoV#Virus*] showed that the C-terminal 3,859 nucleotides, excluding the poly-A tail, includes the C-terminal region of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a triple gene block (TUB), a [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]), and a 3' untranslated region (UTR), all of which are typical of potexviruses.
Although [$LaMMoV#Virus*] is related closely to [$AltMV#Virus*] and [$PapMV#Virus*], its nucleotide sequences differ from those of other previously reported potexviruses.
Therefore, we report [$LaMMoV#Virus*] as a new species of the genus [$Potexvirus#Virus*] that occurs in the [$cucurbit #Plant*][$bottle gourd#Plant*].
