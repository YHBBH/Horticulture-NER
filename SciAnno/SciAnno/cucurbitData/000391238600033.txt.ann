[@Zehneria capillacea (Shumach) C.Jeffrey#Plant*] is a wild edible [@leafy vegetable#Plant*] that belongs to the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
An efficient protocol was developed for in vitro shoot multiplication from nodal segments derived from in vitro generated [$seedlings#Plant*].
The explants were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mg L-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) alone or in combination with 0.5 mg L-1 indole-3-acetic acid.
Multiple shoot formation and root inhibition occurred on all the BAP concentrations tested, except the control which had a single shoot with profuse rooting.
The lowest number of shoots (2.62) with induction frequency of 90% was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg L-1 BAP, while nodal segments cultured on 3.0 mg L-1 BAP gave the highest percentage of shoot induction (98%) with a mean number of 16.98 shoots per culture.
Increasing BAP concentration to 5.0 mg L-1 decreased the shoot induction frequency to 90% with a mean number of 7.23.
Shoots were rooted on MS medium supplemented with 0-2.0 mg L-1 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).
The highest percentage of root induction (100%), mean number of roots (9.68) and root length (29.71 cm) were observed on MS media without NAA.
Rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized in the greenhouse and subsequently established in the field with 98% survival.
The rooting of shoots on hormone-free medium indicates that exogenous auxins may not be required at the rooting stage for the micropropagation of this wild [@cucurbit#Plant*].
