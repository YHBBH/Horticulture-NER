Zoospores of 12 isolates [@O.bornovanus#Virus*] from geographically diverse sites and representing the three host specific [$cucurbit #Plant*]strains were tested as vectors for seven viruses using [$watermelon#Plant*] bait plants and the in vitro acquisition method.
All isolates of the [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]strains transmitted [@melon necrotic spot carmovirus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]) and [@cucumber necrosis tombusvirus#Virus*] ([@CNV#Virus*]) but none transmitted [@petunia asteroid mosaic tombusvirus#Virus*] ([$PAMV#Virus*]) or [@tobacco necrosis necrovirus#Virus*] ([@TNV#Virus*]).
The isolates varied as vectors of three other [@carmoviruses#Virus*]: [@cucumber leaf spot virus#Virus*] ([$CLSV#Virus*]); [@cucumber soil borne virus#Virus*] ([@CSBV#Virus*]); and [@squash necrosis virus#Virus*] ([@SqNV#Virus*]).
All [$cucumber#Plant*] isolates transmitted [$CLSV#Virus*] and [$SqNV#Virus*] but not [$CSBV#Virus*].
Some of the [$melon#Plant*] isolates transmitted [$CLSV#Virus*] and [$SqNV#Virus*] but none transmitted [$CSBV#Virus*].
Two [$squash #Plant*]isolates transmitted [$CSBV#Virus*] and [$SqNV#Virus*] but not [$CLSV#Virus*].
Two isolates of [@O.brassicae#Virus*] transmitted only [$TNV#Virus*] and a third did not transmit any of the viruses.
The species of bait plant sometimes affected transmission.
The most efficient vector strains of [$O.bornovanus#Virus*], as determined by reducing zoospores and virus in the inoculum, were the [$cucumber#Plant*] strain for [$CLSV#Virus*]; the [$cucumber#Plant*] strain for [$CNV#Virus*] if [$cucumber#Plant*] was the bait plant or [$melon#Plant*] strain if [$watermelon#Plant*] was the bait plant; and the [$squash #Plant*]strain for [$SqNV#Virus*].
The plurivorous strain of [$O.brassicae#Virus*] was the most efficient vector of [$TNV#Virus*].
Olpidium bornovanus is the first vector reported for [$CSBV#Virus*] and is confirmed as a vector of [$SqNV#Virus*].
It is proposed that all [$carmoviruses#Virus*] may have fungal vectors.Ligniera sp.did not transmit any of the viruses in one attempt.
