In this study, we describe multiplex [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) coupled with the LiquiChip assay for the identification of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*], [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*], and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] by coamplification with plant mRNA as an internal control.
[@Multiplex reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR products#Method*] were subjected to allele-specific primer extension, then hybridized to carboxylated microspheres with unique fluorescent identifiers followed by detection using the LiquiChip 200 workstation.
This assay is highly specific for distinguishing individual viruses from a mixed viral population and is 10 times more sensitive than [@multiplex RT-PCR#Method*].
In addition, the establishment of this method enabled the detection of [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]in field samples.
