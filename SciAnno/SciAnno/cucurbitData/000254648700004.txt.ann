[@Cucumber powdery mildew#Virus*] is one of the most destructive [@foliar diseases of cucurbits#Disease*].
Extracts of [@Robinia pseudoacacia Linnl#Plant*] are known to have medicinal and poisonous uses.
Here we report that crude extracts (80 mg ml(-1)) of [@R.pseudoacacia#Plant*] had a protective effect (81.25%) against the [@powdery mildew fungus#Virus*], [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*], in culture room conditions.
Further solvent partition assays showed that the most active compounds were in the water phase, and not in the organic phase.
The water-soluble extracts had a much higher antifungal efficacy in both the culture room and greenhouse conditions in a dose-dependent manner, which was further confirmed by in vitro bioassays.[$R.pseudoacacia#Plant*] water-soluble extracts were further separated by [@liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays#Method*], which revealed at least two bioactive compounds.
Our results demonstrated that the water-soluble bioactive compounds in [$R.pseudoacacia#Plant*] extracts have protective effects against [$S.fuliginea#Virus*] in both the culture room and greenhouse conditions, and merits further investigation as an environmentally friendly fungicide.
