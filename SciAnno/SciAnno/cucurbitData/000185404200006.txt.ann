[@Tobamoviruses#Virus*] are among the best characterized and most studied plant viruses.
Three subgroups of [$tobamoviruses#Virus*] correspond to viral genome sequence and host range to include those viruses infecting (i) [$solanaceous #Plant*]plants, (ii) [@brassicas#Plant*], or (iii) [$cucurbits#Plant*] or [$legumes#Plant*].
We isolated a virus from Florida landscape plantings of the [@malvaceous plant#Plant*] [@hibiscus#Plant*] ([@Hibiscus rosasinensis#Plant*]) that appears to be a [$tobamovirus#Virus*] based upon its virion morphology,.
genome organization, and [$coat protein#Gene*] sequence.
The experimental host range of this virus included five malvaceous species but excluded all tested [@brassica#Plant*], [$cucurbit#Plant*], and [$legume#Plant*] species and 12 of the 19 [$solanaceous #Plant*]species tested.
The unique host range and comparison of [$coat protein#Gene*] gene and protein sequences with those of recognized [$tobamoviruses#Virus*] indicate that this is a novel [$tobamovirus#Virus*].
A limited survey revealed that this virus is widespread in [$hibiscus#Plant*] and related species in the Florida landscape.
