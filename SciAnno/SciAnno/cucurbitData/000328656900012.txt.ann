Prior to 2011, foliar blight was not reported as a serious threat to hot pepper cultivation in India.
During the June-to-January cropping season of 2011 and 2012, severe foliar blight epidemics were observed in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states of India.
In all, 52 [$Phytophthora#Virus*] isolates, recovered from blight-affected leaf tissues of hot [$pepper#Plant*] from different localities in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states between 2011 and 2012, were identified: 43 isolates as [@P.boehmeriae#Virus*] and 9 isolates as [@P.capsici#Virus*], based on morphology, [@a similarity search of internal transcribed spacer sequences at GenBank, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns#Method*], and [@species-specific PCR using PC1/PC2 and PB1/PB2 primer pairs#Method*].
The isolates were further assessed for metalaxyl sensitivity and aggressiveness on hot [$pepper#Plant*].
All isolates of [$P.boehmeriae#Virus*] were metalaxyl sensitive while [@P.capsici#Virus*] isolates were intermediate in sensitivity.[$P.boehmeriae#Virus*] isolates were highly aggressive and produced significantly (P < 0.01) larger lesion than those of [@P.capsici#Virus*] isolates.
Thus, emergence of [$P.boehmeriae#Virus*] was responsible for severe leaf blight epidemics on hot [$pepper#Plant*] in South India, although it is not serious [$pathogen#Virus*] on any [$crop#Plant*] in any part of the world.
These results have epidemiological and management implications for the production of hot [$pepper#Plant*] in India.
