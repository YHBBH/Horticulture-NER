The round [@melon#Plant*] [$Praecitrullus fistulosus (Stocks) Pangalo#Plant*] has been cultivated in Asia since ancient times and has been considered an underexploited [$crop#Plant*] in the western world.
In the USA, there is an increased interest in using [@P.fistulosus#Plant*] as a commercial [$vegetable#Plant*], and possibly as a rootstock for grafting [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], or [$cucumber#Plant*].
However, the taxonomic classification of [$P.fistulosus#Plant*] is incomplete and for many years it has been considered a close relative of [$watermelon#Plant*] [[$Citrullus lanatus subsp.vulgaris#Plant*] ([$Schrad.ex Eckl.et Zeyh.#Plant*]) Fursa] and was previously classified as [@Citrullus lanatus subsp.fistulosus (Stocks) Duthie et J.B.Fuller#Plant*].
Here, we used two sets of [$DNA marker#Method*]s to assess the genetic similarity of [$P.fistulosus#Plant*] in relation to [$Citrullus spp.#Plant*]{including [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] subsp.
vulgaris, [@C.lanatus subsp.lanatus#Plant*], [@Citroides group#Plant*] [also known as [$C.lanatus#Plant*] (Thunb.) Matsum.et Nakai subsp.lanatus var.citroides (Bailey) Mansf.ex Greb.], and [$C.colocynthis (L.) Schrad.#Plant*]}, [$Cucumis spp.#Plant*](including [$C.melo#Plant*], [$C.sativus#Plant*], [$C.anguria#Plant*], [@C.meeusei#Plant*], [@C.eyheri#Plant*]), [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*] (Thunb.) Cogn., [$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] (Mol.) Standl.
and [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*](including [@C.moschata Duchesne#Plant*] and the [$winter squash#Plant*] [@C.maxima Duchesne#Plant*]).
The first marker set comprised 501 markers that were produced by 38 primer pairs derived from [$watermelon#Plant*] expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs (designated as EST-SSR primers; produced 311 markers), and by 18 primer pairs derived from ESTs that do not contain SSR motives (designated here as EST-[$PCR#Method*] primers; produced 190 markers).
The second marker set comprised 628 markers that were produced by 18 sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) primer pairs.
The phylogenetic data indicated that among these [$cucurbit species#Plant*], the [$wax gourd#Plant*] B.hispida is the closest to the [$P.fistulosus#Plant*].
Pollen observations, using light microscopy, indicated that each of the [$cucurbit #Plant*]genera examined here has unique pollen morphology.
The[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] spp.have globular pollen grains with a stigmatic surface.
The [$L.siceraria#Plant*] has polygonal pollen [$grains#Plant*] with symmetrical boundaries, while the [$Citrullus spp.#Plant*]and [$Cucumis spp.#Plant*]have ovular (conical) and triangular shaped pollen [$grains#Plant*] (respectively).
The B.hispida and [$P.fistulosus#Plant*] have spherical or semispherical pollen grains.
These pollen features ap[$pea#Plant*]r to be in agreement with the phylogenetic relationships of these two species based on [$DNA marker#Method*]s.
Analysis with 12 SRAP primer pairs revealed low genetic diversity among 18 United States Plant Introductions (PIs) of [$P.fistulosus#Plant*], indicating the need to expand the germplasm collection of this [$cucurbit #Plant*][$crop#Plant*].
