Field research was conducted to examine traditional and alternative fungicide options for controlling leaf diseases of [$carrots#Plant*] caused by[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] and Cercospora.
Wet conditions favoured leaf blights caused by Cercospora and dry favoured[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
Pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin, and tebuconazole controlled both Cercospora leaf blight and[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] whereas sulphur on its own controlled only[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] compared to untreated plots.
Spray oils did not improve[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] control, but when combined with sulphur, improved Cercospora leaf blight control.
A baseline sensitivity study indicated a[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] isolate from South Australia, sourced from [$carrots#Plant*] sprayed with a fungicide containing azoxystrobin over several seasons, was less sensitive to azoxystrobin than an isolate from New South Wales which had not been exposed to the fungicide.
