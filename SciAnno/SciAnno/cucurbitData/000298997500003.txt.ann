The aim of this study was to estimate the phenotypic divergence among fourteen [@pumpkins#Plant*] accessions of the [$cucurbits#Plant*] Germplasm Active Bank of Embrapa Semiarido, in order to support breeding program to these species.
Nine morphoagronomic descriptors were analyzed by the principal components and by [@UPGMA techniques#Method*].
In the analysis of principal components, the formation of three contrasting clusters was observed, each one composed of two accessions.
There occurred also the formation of one core group composed of five accessions, being the accessions called 683 and 684 collected in Bahia and the other in Maranhao.
The most divergent accessions were 620, 624 and 748.
The variables of the greatest contribution to the genetic divergence were diameter, weight and average length of the fruit.
In [@the UPGMA analysis#Method*], obtained from the symmetric mat[$rice#Plant*]s generated by the Mahalanobis distance for the nine descriptors, there was the formation of one core group, composed of ten accessions, whose similarity was 45.71%, with geographically divergent accessions presenting the greatest similarity.
Three accessions were not clustered with others.
The study identified phenotypic variability for the analyzed characters and the absence of relationship between place of collection and phenotypic diversity.
