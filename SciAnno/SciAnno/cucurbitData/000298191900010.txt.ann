Background The [@cucumber#Plant*], [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], is one of the most widely consumed fruit [$vegetables#Plant*] the world over.
The history of its dispersal to the Occident from its centre of origin, the Indian subcontinent, has been incorrectly understood for some time, due to the confusion of [$cucumbers#Plant*] with [@vegetable melons#Plant*].
Iconographic and literary evidence has shown that [$cucumber#Plant*] was absent in Roman times, up to 500 CE, but present in Europe by late medieval times, 1300.
The objective of the present investigation was to determine more accurately when the [$cucumber#Plant*] arrived in Europe and by what route.
   Findings and Conclusions The evidence for the movement of [$C.sativus#Plant*] westward is entirely lexicographical until the 10th century.
Syriac, Persian and Byzantine Greek sources suggest the presence of [$cucumbers#Plant*], to the east and north-east of the Mediterranean Sea (modern Iran, Iraq and Turkey), by the 6th or 7th century.
Arabic medical writings suggest the presence of [$cucumbers#Plant*] in Spain as early as the mid-9th century and in Tunisia by the early 10th century.
Descriptive evidence in Arabic establishes the presence of [$cucumbers#Plant*] in Andalusia by the second half of the 10th century.
Latin translations from Arabic sources indicate the presence of [$cucumbers#Plant*] in southern Italy by the second half of the 11th century.
These writings, together with lexicographical discrepancies in names of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in late medieval Latin writings, suggest that [$cucumber#Plant*] was introduced to Europe by two independent diffusions.
One diffusion appears to have been overland from Persia into eastern and northern Europe and preceded the Islamic conquests.
The other, subsequent diffusion into western and southern Europe, was probably by a mostly maritime route from Persia or the Indian subcontinent into Andalusia.
