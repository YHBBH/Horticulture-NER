Strains of Sphaerotheca fuliginea, one of the causal agents of powdery mildew of cucurbits, were examined for differences in virulence, mating type and DNA polymorphism.
The 28 strains were chosen to be diverse according to host and geographic origin.
Characterization of virulence phenotypes was based on the expression of symptoms on 4 species of cucurbits and 6 cultivars of melon.
Two pathotypes, capable of attacking either cucumber cv.
'Marketer' and melon cv.
'IranH' and squash cv.
'Diamant' or cucumber cv.
'Marketer' and melon cv.
'IranH' were observed.
Tests on melon cultivars revealed 3 races.
In tests of sexual compatibility with reference strains, heterothallism was observed for all isolates.
Frequency of the two mating types differed significantly in the population.
DNA polymorphism was determined both by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.8S DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).
For any one of the 11 restriction enzymes tested all strains presented an identical pattern of ITS RFLP.
RAPD analysis, using 22 primers which provided reproducible patterns, revealed a relatively low degree of polymorphism.
Furthermore, cluster analysis based on RAPD data (152 markers) did not separate groups within the species S.
fuliginea.
No association could be found between virulence, mating type, geographical and host origin and RAPD patterns.
The lack of association between phenotypic and molecular markers and the close fit to linkage equilibrium for the characters examined suggest that recombination may play a role in populations of S.
fuliginea.
