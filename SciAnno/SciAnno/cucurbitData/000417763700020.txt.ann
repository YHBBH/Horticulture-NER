The growing impact of phloem-limited pathogens on high-value crops has led to a renewed interest in understanding how they cause disease.
Although these [$pathogens#Virus*] cause substantial [$crop#Plant*] losses, many are poorly characterized.
In this review, we present examples of phloem-limited [$pathogens#Virus*] that include intracellular bacteria with and without cell walls, and viruses.
Phloem-limited [$pathogens#Virus*] have small genomes and lack many genes required for core metabolic processes, which is, in part, an adaptation to the unique phloem environment.
For each [$pathogen#Virus*] class, we present multiple case studies to highlight aspects of disease caused by phloem-limited [$pathogens#Virus*].
The [$pathogens#Virus*] presented include Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus ([$citrus greening#Disease*]), [@Arsenophonus bacteria#Virus*], [$Serratia marcescens#Virus*] ([$cucurbit yellow vine disease#Disease*]), [@Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris#Virus*] ([@Aster Yellows Witches' Broom#Virus*]), [@Spiroplasma kunkelii#Virus*], [$Potato leafroll virus#Virus*] and [$Citrus tristeza virus#Virus*].
We focus on commonalities in the virulence strategies of these [$pathogens#Virus*], and aim to stimulate new discussions in the hope that widely applicable disease management strategies can be found.
