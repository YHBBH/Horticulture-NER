A [@cucurbit species#Plant*] named [@Praecitrullus fistulosus (Stocks) Pangalo#Plant*], which thrives in India, is considered to be a distant relative of [$watermelon#Plant*].
Recent experiments indicated that it has mild resistance to [@whiteflies#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]).
However, our attempts to cross various US plant introductions (PIs) of P.fistulosus with [$watermelon#Plant*] or other [$Citrullus#Plant*] PIs have not been successful.
Thus, to determine genetic relatedness among those species,[@ phylogenetic analysis [based on simple sequence repeat (SSR)-anchored (also termed ISSR), and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers]#Method*] was conducted among PIs of [@P.fistulosus#Plant*], [@Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*] ([$watermelon#Plant*]), [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*] and the [@wild Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*].
[@Phylogenetic relationships#Method*] were also examined with [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] ([$melon#Plant*]), [$Cucumis sativus (cucumber)#Plant*], and wild [$Cucumis#Plant*] species including C.africanus, [$C.metuliferus#Plant*], C.anguria, C.meeusei, and C.zeyheri.
Wide genetic distance exists between [$Citrullus#Plant*] and [$Cucumis#Plant*] groups (8% genetic similarity).
[$Phylogenetic relationships#Method*] among [$Citrullus species#Plant*] and subspecies are closer (25-55% genetic similarity) as compared with those among most [$Cucumis#Plant*] species (14-68% genetic similarity).[$P.fistulosus#Plant*] ap[$pea#Plant*]red to be distant from both [$Cucumis#Plant*] and [$Citrullus species#Plant*] (genetic similarity between [$P.fistulosus#Plant*] and [$Cucumis#Plant*] or [$Citrullus#Plant*] groups is less than 3%).
Although wide genetic differences and reproductive barriers exist among [$cucurbit species#Plant*] examined in this study, they are still considered as potential germplasm source for enhancing [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] using traditional breeding and biotechnology procedures.
