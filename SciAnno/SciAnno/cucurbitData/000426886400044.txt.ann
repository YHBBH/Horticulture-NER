To test the stability of postharvest solid wet [$fruit pulp#Plant*] [$butternut squash#Plant*] [@Cucurbita moschata Duch.#Plant*], 'UnaApal Abanico 75' by silage technology three treatments with sodium chloride (T1=3, T2=4 and T3=5%) was used.
With 16, 17 and 19% moisture removal, respectively, of wet solid before ensiling.
After 21 days of anaerobic fermentation, the final product was stable with: 18.6, 19.2 and 20.7% of dry matter (DM); pH on 3.66, 3.64 and 3.65, respectively, without significant differences (P<0.05); crude protein on 13.2, 12.9 and 12.9% and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) at 23.8, 19.5 and 18.6%, respectively, without significant differences (P<0.05).
The average volatile fatty acids was 6.6% with 0.34; 1.99 and 0.87% to acetic, lactic and butyric, respectively.
All values of control microbial growth (mesophilic aerobes, molds, yeasts, total coliforms, clostridial spores, [$Escherichia coli#Virus*] and Salmonella) were expressed under the provisions of the Colombian Technical Standard.
The silage saline 5% sodium chloride is the ideal technique to preserve and store the [$butternut squash#Plant*] fruit.
