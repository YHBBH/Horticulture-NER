[@Bacterial wilt#Disease*] is one of the most destructive diseases affecting a wide range of [$crops#Plant*] in the [$Cucurbits#Plant*] family including [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), and [$squash #Plant*](Cucubita pepo).
The disease is caused by [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*], a Gram-negative and xylem-inhabiting species of Erwinia, which [$pathogen#Virus*]ic mechanism is poorly understood.
Many Gram-negative phytobacteria induce hypersensitive response (HR) in non-[$host plants#Plant*], an immunity reaction triggered by [$pathogen#Virus*] recognition.
With some exemptions, Erwinia species-notably E.amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight of rosaceous [$crops#Plant*], and the reclassified soft rot [$pathogens#Virus*], [@Pectobacterium#Virus*] and [@Dickeya species#Virus*] (formerly [@E.carotovora#Virus*] and [@E.chrysanthemi#Virus*])-have been known to elicit HR in [$tobacco#Plant*].
However, concerning its [$pathogen#Virus*]ic mechanism, the elicitation of classic HR has not been reported for some less-studied Erwinia species including [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*].
We characterized the induction of HR by the [$bacterial wilt#Disease*] [$pathogen#Virus*] in [$tobacco#Plant*] ([@Nicotiana tabacum cultivar 'Xanthi'#Plant*]) using visual and physiological methods.
We surveyed 21 [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] strains and found that all of them elicited programmed cell death.
Three strains (HCa1-5, UnisCu1-1, and MISpSq) fluorescently labeled with GFP could be visualized in the infiltrated leaves.
We aligned the sequences of their HR-inducing protein, harpin (HrpN), predicted the secondary structures, and located the position of putative HR elicitors.
We discovered differences between[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] and [$Cucumis#Plant*] strains and found a close association of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] HrpN with those of Pantoea sp., Erwinia piriflorinigrans, and Erwinia pyrifoliae.
Pre-infiltration of [$tobacco#Plant*] leaves with a lower cell population prevented HR following a subsequent challenge at the same area with HR-inducing levels of inoculum.
The selected strains induced leaf conductivity levels similar to the HR-inducing E.amylovora strain E9, and their populations in the leaves decreased days after infiltration.
Our results indicate that [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] induces a classic HR in [$tobacco#Plant*] just like other HR-inducing Erwinia species.
