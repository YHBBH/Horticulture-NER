The effect of moisture on seed longevity during experimental storage was investigated in [@cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]), [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]), and [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] Matsum and Nakai).
Seeds were stored hermetically at various moisture contents between 8.0 and 17.0% (fresh weight basis) at 35 degrees C for up to 215, 366, and 175 days for [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*], respectively.
Normal germination percentages were determined periodically.
A one-step approach was taken to analyze the effects of moisture on longevity and to estimate K-E and C-W.
K-E and C-W values were found to be 4.86 and 1.59 for [$watermelon#Plant*], 6.11 and 2.59 for [$melon#Plant*], and 5.35 and 2.03 for [$cucumber#Plant*], respectively.
[$Watermelon#Plant*] seeds are the most sensitive to seed storage, whilst [$melon#Plant*] seeds have the greatest longevity.
These constants can be used to predict the viability of these [$cucurbit seeds#Plant*] under various storage conditions.
