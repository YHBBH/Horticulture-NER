[@Cucurbits#Plant*] are the most important [$vegetable#Plant*] family in Japan, and they are produced throughout the country.
Some unique [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] in particular, were developed in Japan, because of its geographic isolation and, until the mid 19(th) century, its political isolation.
In the 20(th) century, North-Chinese cultivars of [$cucumber#Plant*] and Western cultivars of [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] also became available in Japan in addition to the East-Asian varieties.
These imports became the basis for modern Japanese [$cucurbit#Plant*] cultivars.
In this report, we briefly describe Japanese [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivars and their history.
