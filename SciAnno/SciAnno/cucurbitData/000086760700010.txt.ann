The approach of [@pathogen-derived resistance#Method*] was investigated as a means to develop [@squash mosaic comovirus#Virus*] ([@SqMV#Virus*])-resistant [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Transgenic [$squash #Plant*]lines with both [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) genes of the [$melon#Plant*] strain of [$SqMV#Virus*] were produced and crossed with nontransgenic [$squash#Plant*].
Further [@greenhouse, screenhouse and field tests#Method*] were done with R-1 plants from three independent lines that showed susceptible, recovery, or resistant phenotypes after inoculations with [$SqMV#Virus*].
Nearly all inoculated plants of the resistant line ([$SqMV#Virus*]-127) were resistant under greenhouse and field conditions and less so under screenhouse conditions.
Plants of the recovery phenotype line ([$SqMV#Virus*]-3) were susceptible when inoculated at the cotyledon stage but leaves that developed later did not show symptoms.
The susceptible line ([$SqMV#Virus*]-22) developed symptoms that persisted and spread throughout the plant.
Plants were also analyzed for transcription rates of the [$CP#Gene*] transgenes and s[$tea#Plant*]dy state transgene RNA levels.
Results showed that the resistant line [$SqMV#Virus*]-127 displayed post-transcriptional silencing of the [$CP#Gene*] transgene as evidenced by high transcription rates but concomitant low accumulation of transgene transcripts.
This is the first report on the development of transgenic [$squash #Plant*]that are resistant to [$SqMV#Virus*].
