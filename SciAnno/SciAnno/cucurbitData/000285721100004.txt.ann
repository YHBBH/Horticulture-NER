[@Bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) of cucurbits#Disease*] is caused by the Gram-negative [$bacterium Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*].
The disease gained importance in the late 1980s, after devastating outbreaks in [$watermelon#Plant*] fields in several states in the US.
Since then, [$BFB#Disease*] has spread worldwide, and has been reported in other [$cucurbits#Plant*] such as [$melon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$cucumber#Plant*].
[$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] is a seedborne [$pathogen#Virus*] of highly destructive potential.
Under favorable conditions, the bacterium spreads rapidly throughout nurseries and in the field, leading to seedling blight or, at a later stage, fruit rot.
Strategies for managing [$BFB#Disease*] are limited and there are no reliable sources of [$BFB#Disease*] resistance.
The disease therefore represents a serious threat to the [$cucurbit #Plant*]industry.
Despite its economic importance, there is little knowledge on basic aspects of the [$pathogen#Virus*]'s biology or on the molecular basis of [$BFB#Disease*] [$pathogen#Virus*]esis.
Recently, the genome sequence of one [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] strain was released, making a great contribution to the investigation of basic aspects of [$BFB#Disease*].
A better understanding of these aspects will contribute to improved screens for [$BFB#Disease*] resistance and to the development of more effective strategies to manage this threatening disease.
