The success of [@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] detection by seed health testing of commercial [$cucurbitaceous#Plant*] seeds depends on the efficiency of [$pathogen#Virus*] extraction.
In the present study, different extraction techniques were compared to identify factors that influence [$A.citrulli #Virus*]detection in naturally contaminated [$cucurbit seeds#Plant*].
Embryo-infected [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds, produced by pistil inoculation, were mixed with non-infected seeds to generate samples (n = 1000 seeds) with low infection levels (approximately 10 degrees cells per sample).
Additionally, two naturally infested [$melon#Plant*] seed lots were tested.
[$A.citrulli #Virus*]was extracted from seeds by soaking or crushing, followed by one or two centrifugation steps.
Samples extracted by soaking seeds yielded better amplification efficiency (103%) compared with crushing (93%), as determined by [$quantitative real-time PCR#Method*] analysis.
This was most likely due to a reduction of the concentration of inhibitors present in the DNA samples.
[$PCR assays#Method*] using three different [$A.citrulli#Virus*]-specific primer sets highlighted that soaking followed by two centrifugation steps enhanced [$pathogen#Virus*] detection (100% of the samples) and the mean cycle threshold (Ct) value was significantly lower than those observed for the other [$pathogen#Virus*] extraction techniques.
These results indicate that the optimised extraction protocol combined with [$PCR#Method*] analysis can improve routine seed health testing for [$A.citrulli#Virus*].
