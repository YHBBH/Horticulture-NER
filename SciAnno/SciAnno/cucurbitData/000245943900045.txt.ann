[@Powdery mildew of cucurbits#Disease*] in Central Europe is caused by two ascomycete fungi, [@Golovinomyces cichoracearum s.l.(Gc) #Virus*]([@syn.Erysiphe cichoracearum s.L#Virus*]) and [@Podosphaera xanthii (Px)#Virus*] ([@syn.Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]).
Distribution of both species was studied in the period of 1995-2001.
Nearly 800 leaf samples with disease symptoms were collected from [$cucurbitaceous vegetables#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] /Cp/,[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima /Cm/, [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] /Cs/, [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] /Cmel/) in 47 districts of Bohemia and Moravia.
Some samples were collected from the same field several times during a vegetation period and selected locations were visited subsequently each year.
The identification of both [$pathogens#Virus*] was based on the examination of the morphological characters of dry imperfect [$conidia#Virus*] in a 3% KOH solution in light microscope.
[$CP#Gene*] and Cm are the most common hosts of [@powdery mildew#Virus*].
Occurrence of[$ powdery mildew#Disease*] on [$cucumbers#Plant*] was reduced because of [$cucumber#Plant*] [$downy mildew#Virus*] ([$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*]) infection and its competitive actions to[$ powdery mildew#Disease*]s.
[$Powdery mildew#Disease*] infection was also recorded on plants of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] in Southern Moravia.
Gc is the predominating species, detected on 98% of locations.
It was accompanied by Px on 24% of locations (mixed infections).
The occurrence of Px as the only[$ powdery mildew#Disease*] species was proved on 2% of locations.
Recent occurrence of Px in the Czech Republic corresponds with data on Px fast spreading and prevailing on [$cucurbits#Plant*] in West and South Europe.
However, Gc is the strongly predominating[$ powdery mildew#Disease*] species largely distributed throughout the country.
The [$hyperparasitic fungus Ampelomyces quisqualis#Virus*] was detected on 30% of samples analysed, mainly in Gc hyphae and basal cells of conidiophores.
The epidemic occurrence of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] on [$field crops#Plant*] of Cp and Cs significantly reduced or eliminated[$ powdery mildew#Disease*] symptoms on plants.
