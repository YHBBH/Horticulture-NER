Distribution, disease severity and temporal changes in pathogenicity structure of the two [@powdery mildew#Virus*] species, [@Golovinomyces cichoracearum s.l.(Gc)#Virus*] and [$Podosphaera xanthii (Px)#Virus*], were monitored on [@cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*] in the Czech Republic (CR) in 2001-2003.
[$Cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] was represented by a predominance of Gc and by the sporadic occurrence of Px and corresponded with the earlier published data.
The highest frequency of [@cucurbit powdery mildews#Virus*] was recorded on [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] and [$C.maxima#Plant*] (90%, 84%, respectively), and was very rarely observed on [@Cueumis sativus#Plant*] (4-5%).
A medium level of disease intensity (25-50%) occurred on [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
There was proved a high variability in [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of surveyed [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] populations: 14 different pathotypes (8 Gc, 6 Px) and 79 races (58 Gc, 21 Px) were observed.
Isolates virulent to [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] (line MR-1) and avirulent to [$C melo#Plant*] (Iran-H) were found in both [@powdery mildew species#Virus*].
These data demonstrate existence of new and until now unknown virulence/avirulence and susceptibility/resistance factors in [$pathogen#Virus*] populations and [$host plants#Plant*], respectively.
Occurrence of some highly [$pathogen#Virus*]ic strains of Gc was noted during the years 2001-2003.
A remarkable shift toward increased virulence was observed for both Gc and Px over the three-year period.
