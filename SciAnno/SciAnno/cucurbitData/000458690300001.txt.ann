The use of [@grafted vegetable seedlings#Plant*] has been popular in many countries during recent years, and several[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] species and their interspecific hybrids have been tested as rootstocks.
Graft-scion incompatibility and lower fruit quality have prevented their commercial use.
In this study, the efficacy of grafting the commercial Khassib [$cucumber#Plant*] hybrid onto various [$cucurbits#Plant*], used as rootstocks, was examined in a greenhouse experiment.
This experiment was done in a completely randomized design with eight treatments: local landraces of [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([@Ghalyani#Plant*]) and [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([@Tanbal#Plant*]) and commercial[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] interspecific hybrids (909, 913, Ferro, 64-19, and [$Shintoza#Plant*]).
Ungrafted plants were used as controls.
Results indicated that the highest survival rates were using Ferro hybrid (94%),[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima ([$Tanbal#Plant*]) (92%), 64-19 and [$Shintoza#Plant*] (90%).
These results appeared to be related to the stem diameter of the rootstocks and, to a lesser extent, to the scion diameter.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] production was not improved by grafting.
The highest yield was obtained with Ferro rootstock, but it was no different compared to ungrafted plants.
A significantly lower production than the control was observed with [$Ghalyani#Plant*] (-44%), 913 (-73%) and 64-19 (-35%) rootstocks.
Total soluble solids (TSS) of fruit produced by ungrafted plants was significantly higher than the other treatments.
The highest length/diameter ratio was obtained with 909 and [$Ghalyani#Plant*] rootstocks, whereas more stocky fruit were produced by plants grafted onto [$Tanbal#Plant*] and 64-19 rootstocks.
