[@Melothria sphaerocarpa#Plant*] ([@egusi gourd#Plant*]) is an economically important [$cucurbit species #Plant*]cultivated only for its seeds in West and Central Africa but also found in South and Central America.
The species is thought to originate from America and sister of wild relatives such as [$Melothria candolleana#Plant*] and [$Melothria campestris#Plant*], which thrive in America only.
The species is rich in nutrients and is a useful [$crop#Plant*] to ensure food and nutritional security.
It also has several applications in industries for cooking oil, soap, paint and biodiesel production.
However, the production of [$egusi gourd#Plant*] is declining because of its low yield, the requirement of stakes and the long production cycle.
These bottlenecks lead to the substitution of [$egusi gourd#Plant*] by other sister egusi [$crops#Plant*] and increase the threat on the species.
This review documents current knowledge for improving existing cultivars of [$egusi gourd#Plant*] to promote sustainable utilization.
Breeding objectives may include developing early maturing, high yielding, as well as pests and diseases resistant varieties.
Current in situ and ex situ conservation strategies need to be strengthened.
Further investigations need to be carried out on the phylogeny and phylogeography of the genus [$Melothria#Plant*], the genetic diversity among American and African populations, the reproductive biology and nutritional value.
