Among the 115 genera belonging to the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] family, four are of great economic importance: [$Citrullus#Plant*], [$Cucumis#Plant*], [$Cucurbita#Plant*] and [$Lagenaria#Plant*].
Four countries (China, Turkey, Iran and USA) produce about 50 % of the world production (29,9 millions of ton) of [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]).
[$Watermelon#Plant*] is of African origin and has been introduced quite lately in Europe.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) cultivation is the second largest of the [$Cucurbits#Plant*] (23,2 millions of ton) and four countries (China, Iran, Turkey and USA) represent 66 % of the world production.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] has been domesticated probably in India and was introduced in Europe at early times (during the ancient Greek period).
Four countries (China, Turkey, Iran and USA) produce 57 % of the 16,2 millions of ton of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) produce in the world.
[@Melon#Plant*] is of African origin but, the centre of diversity is in Asia from Turkey to Japan.
[$Melon#Plant*] was introduced probably by three independent ways in Europe during the Creek or the Roman Period.
The [$Cucurbita#Plant*] species are of American origin and very polymorphic (mainly C.
pepo).
The first four producers (China, Ukraine, Argentina and Turkey) represent 45% of the world production.
[$Lagenaria#Plant*] has been domesticated probably independently several times in tropical countries.
