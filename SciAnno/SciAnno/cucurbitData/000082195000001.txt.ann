Transplanting generally results in more rapid stand establishment than direct seeding for [@cucurbit crops#Plant*].
A 2-year field study was conducted to examine the pattern of rooting of [$watermelon#Plant*] [[@Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.& Nak.#Plant*]] following [@usage of different planting methods#Method*], and to determine subsequent effects on [$crop#Plant*] yield.
Root length was assessed by obtaining soil cores three times per growing season to a depth of 75 cm.
Transplanted [$watermelons#Plant*] generally had greater root length density in the upper 30 cm of soil 4 to 7 weeks after planting (WAP).
However, by 11 to 12 WAP root distribution was similar over the entire 75 cm soil profile for the two planting methods.
Total marketable yields were comparable for direct seeded and transplanted [$watermelons#Plant*] during 1995, but transplanted [$watermelon#Plant*] yield exceeded direct seeded yield by 40% in 1996.
In both years, 90% to 100% of the marketable yield of transplanted [$watermelons#Plant*] Was obtained at the first harvest, compared to 0% to 55% for direct seeded [$watermelons#Plant*].
These findings suggest that rapid root proliferation of transplanted [$watermelons#Plant*] may be an important factor in their earlier establishment and increased early yields as compared to direct seeded [$watermelons#Plant*].
