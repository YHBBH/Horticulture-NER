An uncharacterized virus was isolated from greenhouse-grown [@cucumber#Plant*] plants.
Biological and serological data described in the present study indicated that the virus belonged in the genus [$Tobamovirus#Virus*].
The host range of the virus included several plant species within the family [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
The virus designated [@Cucumber fruit mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@CFMMV#Virus*]) causes severe mottling or mosaic on [$cucumber#Plant*] fruits, and its fast spread within greenhouses could lead to significant economic losses in [$cucumber#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
The genome of [$CFMMV#Virus*] has been completely sequenced and its genome organization was typical of a [$Tobamovirus#Virus*].
However, its sequence was distinct from other described viruses within the group of [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [@Tobamoviruses#Virus*].
[@Comparisons of sequences#Method*] and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] suggested that the [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$Tobamoviruses#Virus*] be separated into two subgroups: subgroup I comprising the strains and isolates referred to in the literature as [@Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) (CV3, CV4, [$CGMMV#Virus*]W, [$CGMMV#Virus*]-SH, and [$CGMMV#Virus*]-Is) and subgroup II comprising [$CFMMV#Virus*], [@Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@KGMMV#Virus*]), and the Yodo strain of [$CGMMV#Virus*], which is closely related to [$KGMMV#Virus*] and may be considered a strain of it.
