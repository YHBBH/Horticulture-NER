This study was conducted to establish an efficient screening method to identify [$cucurbits#Plant*] resistant to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
[$Powdery mildew#Disease*] [$fungus#Virus*] was obtained from a single lesion of infected [$cucumber#Plant*] leaf in 2010 at Daejeon.
The [$fungus#Virus*] was identified as [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]race 1 based on morphological characteristics and resistance responses of four [$melon#Plant*] differentials.
Development of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] caused by the fungal isolate on 34 commercial cultivars of [$cucumber#Plant*] was investigated at three plant growth stages in a greenhouse.
The degree of resistance of cotyledons of each cultivar to the [$fungus#Virus*] was not correlated with that of whole plant, but[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] occurrence in the first true leaf was highly correlated with resistance at the level of the whole plant.
Based on these results, the first true leaf of [$cucurbit cultivar#Plant*]s can be used for screening of resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
In addition, variation of resistance of commercial 12 [$cucumber#Plant*] and 26 [$melon cultivars#Plant*] to the[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] [$fungus#Virus*] due to different growing seasons was tested.
In the case of [$cucumber#Plant*], the resistance response in some cultivars was influenced by growing season.
The resistant cultivars showed higher resistance in the warm season than in the cool season.
By contrast, the resistant [$melon cultivars#Plant*] demonstrated strong resistance in all the tested growing seasons.
Interestingly, the tested[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] [$pathogen#Virus*], a member of [$P.xanthii#Plant*] race 1, was not [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on seven cultivars of [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]).
To follow up on this, diverse race 1 isolates of [$P.xanthii#Plant*] should be collected and tested.
