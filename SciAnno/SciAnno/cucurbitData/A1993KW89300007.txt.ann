AB The spread of genetic diversity of [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) is in a close correlation to the solving of the problem of inter-specific hybridization within the [$genus Cucumis#Plant*].
Classical methods were not successful till now to obtain fertile hybrid plants.
As a prospective the use of some biotechnological methods seems to be in this direction.
This is mainly the case of embryocultures and the fusion of protoplasts.
In this association, the use of some biochemical methods seems to be very purposeful, e.g.
the study of a spectrum of isoenzymes as genetic markers.
Inter-specific hybridization between [$C.sativus#Plant*] and [$C.melo#Plant*] is now considered as the most important.
Its successful materialization should lead to the formation of materials with resistance to the number of serious diseases of [$cucumbers#Plant*], especially [$downy mildew#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([@Pseudo-peronospora cubensis#Virus*]) and[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] ([@Erysiphe cic oracearum#Virus*] and [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]).
