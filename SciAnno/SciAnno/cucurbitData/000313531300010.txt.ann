[@Damping-off and vine decline diseases#Disease*] affect most greenhouse [$cucumber crops#Plant*] in Oman, with losses frequently exceeding 25% of [$seedlings#Plant*] and adult plants.
As a consequence of some recent reports that disease control using metalaxyl fungicides were ineffective, seven local and introduced rootstocks were assessed for their response to [$Pythium aphanidermatum#Virus*].
The rootstocks were also tested for grafting compatibility and production potential under greenhouse conditions.
During artificial inoculation trials, no damping-off symptoms were observed in the Hercules and Titan varieties, [$ridge gourd#Plant*] or [$sponge gourd#Plant*].
In three separate greenhouse trials, Titan, Hercules and [@squash var.Magda#Plant*] showed no damping-off or [@vine decline#Disease*] symptoms up to 45 days after transplanting.
When [$cucumber#Plant*] was grafted onto the seven rootstocks, no symptoms were observed in the [$cucumber plants#Plant*] grafted onto Titan and Hercules rootstocks, whereas the [$cucumber#Plant*] grafted onto the other rootstocks showed varying levels of damping-off and [$vine decline diseases#Disease*] (10-40%).
The Titan and Hercules rootstocks significantly increased the vegetative growth and the fruit number, weight and length compared to the self-grafted [$cucumbers#Plant*], non-grafted [$cucumbers#Plant*] and [$cucumbers#Plant*] that were grafted onto the other rootstocks (P < 0.05).
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the influence of grafting on the resistance to [$Pythium#Virus*] and on the vegetative growth and yield of greenhouse [$cucumbers#Plant*].
