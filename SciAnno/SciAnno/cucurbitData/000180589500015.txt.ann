[@Phloem protein 2#Gene*] ([$PP2#Gene*]) is one of the most abundant and enigmatic proteins in the phloem sap.
Although thought to be associated with structural P-protein, [$PP2#Gene*] is translocated in the assimilate stream where its lectin activity or RNA-binding properties can exert effects over long distances.
Analyzing the diversity of these proteins in [$vascular plants#Plant*] led to the identification of [$PP2#Gene*]-like genes in species from 17 angiosperm and gymnosperm genera.
This wide distribution of [$PP2#Gene*] genes in the plant kingdom indicates that they are ancient and common in [$vascular plants#Plant*].
Their presence in cereals and gymnosperms, both of which lack structural P-protein, also supports a wider role for these proteins.
Within this superfamily, [$PP2#Gene*] proteins have considerable size polymorphism.
This is attributable to variability in the length of the amino terminus that extends from a highly conserved domain.
The conserved [$PP2#Gene*] domain was identified in the proteins encoded by six genes from several [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$celery#Plant*] ([@Apium graveolens#Plant*]), and [@Arabidopsis#Plant*] that are specifically expressed in the sieve element-companion cell complex.
The acquisition of additional modular domains in the amino-terminal extensions of other [$PP2#Gene*]-like proteins could reflect divergence from its phloem function.
