[@Anthracnose disease#Disease*] caused by [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], induces severe damage to [$cucurbits#Plant*] worldwide.
Resistance of 112 commercial cultivars of [$cucurbits#Plant*] to [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] was evaluated.
[$Seedlings #Plant*]of each cultivar at 2- to 3-leaf stage were inoculated with [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] KACC 40809 by spraying spore suspension of the [$fungus#Virus*] at a concentration of 4.0 x 10(5) spores/mL.
Among the 36 cultivars of [$cucumber#Plant*], 'Asiastrike', 'Tongilbaedadagi', 'Daeseon', 'Cheongrokmatjjang', 'Nokyacheongcheong', and 'Asianogak' were moderately resistant and the others were susceptible.
All the tested cultivars of [$melon#Plant*] (33) and [$watermelon#Plant*] (4) showed highly susceptible response to [$C.orbiculare#Virus*].
On the other hand, the [$squash #Plant*]cultivars (17) represented less susceptibility to the [$fungus#Virus*] than the other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Of the [$squash #Plant*]cultivars, 'Gammirak' and 'Teotbat' were resistant and 12 cultivars were moderately resistant.
Among the [$rootstocks#Plant*] for [$cucurbits#Plant*], ten cultivars including 'JjeuyakaEX', 'Nunbusyeo', 'Union', 'RS111', 'Ganggeuntoza', 'Hwangjaetoza', 'NO.8', '[$Shintoza#Plant*]', 'Bulpaetoza', and 'Newtype' shoved high resistance to the [$anthracnose#Virus*] [$pathogen#Virus*].
From the results, the resistant cultivars could be used as sources of resistance to [$cucurbits#Plant*] [$anthracnose#Virus*] ([$C.orbiculare#Virus*]) in the future breeding programs.
