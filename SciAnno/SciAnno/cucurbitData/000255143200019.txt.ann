[@Cucurbit leaf crumple virus#Virus*] ([$CuLCrV#Virus*]) is an emergent and potentially economically important bipartite [$begomovirus#Virus*] first identified in volunteer [$watermelon#Plant*] plants in the Imperial Valley of southern California in 1998.
[@Field surveys#Method*] indicated that [$CuLCrV#Virus*] has become established in the Imperial Valley; and field plot studies revealed that [$CuLCrV#Virus*] primarily infects [$cucurbits#Plant*], including [$cantaloupe#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*].
Full-length DNA-A and DNA-B clones of an Imperial Valley isolate of [$CuLCrV#Virus*] were obtained by [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) with overlapping primers.
These clones were infectious in various [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$common bean#Plant*] (cv.
Topcrop); symptoms included stunted growth and leaf crumple, curl, and chlorosis.
[$CuLCrV#Virus*] was not saptransmissible, and immunolocalization and DNA in situ hybridization studies revealed that it is phloem-limited.
A [$CuLCrV#Virus*] agroinoculation system was generated, and host range studies revealed differential susceptibility in [$cucurbits#Plant*], with [$squash#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$cantaloupe#Plant*], and [$honeydew melon#Plant*] being most to least susceptible, respectively.
Germplasm screening studies identified a number of resistant [$cantaloupe#Plant*] and [$honeydew melon#Plant*] cultivars.
The genome organization of this [$CuLCrV#Virus*] isolate ([$CuLCrV#Virus*]-CA) is similar to other bipartite [$begomoviruses#Virus*], and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] placed [$CuLCrV#Virus*] in the [$Squash leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([$SLCV#Virus*]) cluster of New World bipartite [$begomoviruses#Virus*].
A [@CuLCrV-specific PCR test#Method*] was developed which allows for differentiation from other [$begomoviruses#Virus*], including [$SLCV#Virus*].
