[@Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) HA5-1#Virus*], a mild mutant of [@type P Hawaii severe strain#Virus*] ([@PRSV P-HA#Virus*]), has been widely used for the control of [@PRSV type P strains#Virus*] in [@papaya#Plant*], but did not provide practical protection against [@PRSV type W strains#Virus*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
In order to widen the protection effectiveness against W strains, chimeric mild strains were constructed from HA5-1 to carry the heterologous 3' genomic region of a type W strain W-CI.
[$Virus#Virus*] accumulation of recombinants and their [$cross-protection#Method*] effectiveness against W-CI and P-HA were investigated.
In horn [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]plants, the recombinant carrying both the heterologous [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) coding region and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), but not the lieterologous [$CP#Gene*] coding region alone, significantly enhanced the protection against W-CI.
The heterologous YUTR alone is critical for the enhancement of the protection against W-C1 in horn [$melon#Plant*], but not in [$zucchini squash#Plant*].
In [$papaya#Plant*], the heterologous [$CP#Gene*] coding re-ion or 3'UTR alone, but not both to, ether, significantly reduced the effectiveness of [$cross protectio#Method*]n against P-HA.
Our recombinants provide broader protection against both type W and P strains in [$cucurbits#Plant*]; however, the protective effectiveness is also affected by virus accumulation, the organization of the 3' genomic region, and host factors.
