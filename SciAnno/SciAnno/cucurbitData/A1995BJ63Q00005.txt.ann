AB An unusual disease of [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) in India with symptoms of leaf crinkling, mottling, yellowing, and necrotic streaks on vines, shortened internodes, upright branches, and necrosis and dieback of the buds was shown to be caused by the [$watermelon#Plant*] strain of [$tomato#Plant*] spotted wilt virus ([$TSWV#Virus*]-W).
The virus was identified by host range, transmission by thrips, virus particle morphology, and serology.
The systemic infection of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and transmission by the vector Thrips flavus distinguished this isolate from most other [$tospoviruses#Virus*].
Results of [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]) with polyclonal antibodies indicated that [@TSWV-W#Virus*] is serologically related to the [$TSWV-W#Virus*] isolate from Taiwan, but not to [$tomato#Plant*] spotted wilt virus ([$TSWV#Virus*]) or [@impatiens necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([@INSV#Virus*]).
Although the [$watermelon#Plant*] isolate is serologically related to the [@groundnut bud necrosis virus#Virus*] ([@GBNV#Virus*]) from India, it differs in host range.
This is the first report of [$tospovirus#Virus*] naturally infecting [$watermelon#Plant*] in India.
