The aim of this work was to investigate the ability of [@Acidovorax avenae ssp.
citrulli#Virus*], the causal agent of [@bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]), to colonize female [$watermelon#Plant*] blossoms, and to explore the relationship between blossom inoculum dosage and seed infestation.
Under greenhouse conditions [@A.avenae ssp.citrulli#Virus*] colonized stigmas and styles of female [$watermelon#Plant*] blossoms reaching populations of approximate to 10(7) to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) per blossom for 96 h after inoculation.
[$Acidovorax avenae ssp.citrulli#Virus*] growth on stigmas was slower than that of Pseudomonas syringae Cit7, a non-[$pathogen#Virus*]ic, foliar epiphyte of [$tomato#Plant*].
While pollination reduced growth of [$A.avenae ssp.citrulli#Virus*], but P.syringae Cit7 was unaffected.
Both bacteria colonized style tissues but bacterial growth in the style was significantly less than the stigma.
Blossom inoculation with approximate to 1 x 10(3)[$A.avenae ssp.citrulli#Virus*] CFU/blossom led to 36-55% infested seedlots within symptomless fruits.
On average 14% of the [$seedlings#Plant*] produced from these seedlots displayed [$BFB#Disease*] symptoms.
There was a strong positive correlation between [$A.avenae ssp.citrulli#Virus*] inoculum concentration applied to blossoms and the percentage of infested seedlots, as determined by the seedling grow-out assay (R-2 = 0.94).
However, this relationship was weaker when seedlot infestation was determined by a [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*]-based assay (R-2 = 0.34).
There was also a strong positive linear relationship between [$A.avenae ssp.citrulli#Virus*] blossom inoculum dose and the mean percentage of [$BFB#Disease*]-infected [$seedlings#Plant*] (R-2 = 0.99) produced in seedling grow-out assays.
These data support the hypothesis that blossom colonization might be involved in seed infestation under field conditions.
