The [@Acidovorax genus#Virus*] belongs to the [@Proteobacteria phylum#Virus*], and comprises species that possess a variety of lifestyles, with its members inhabiting different environments, including soil, water and interactions with eukaryotic organisms.
In the present chapter, we focus on Acidovorax species that are [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on plants.
Acidovorax species are able to cause disease to a variety of agriculturally and economically important [$crops#Plant*].
Moreover, some diseases caused by [@Acidovorax#Virus*] strains have been spreading worldwide in recent years and their importance is substantially increasing.
One example is seedling blight and [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] caused by [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], a disease that was barely known until the late 1980s' and today is one of the most serious threats to the [$cucurbit #Plant*]industry worldwide.
Here we summarize taxonomical aspects of plant-[$pathogen#Virus*]ic species of [$Acidovorax#Virus*] and describe major diseases caused by members of this genus, with emphasis on their [$epidemiology#Method*], control and basic aspects of [$pathogen#Virus*]esis and plant [$pathogen#Virus*] interactions.
