Although many fungicides are registered for use to control[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] on [$cucurbits#Plant*], management of resistance to fungicides in [$pathogen#Virus*] populations still remains a major challenge.
Two biopesticides Regalia SC and HMO 736 were evaluated in the greenhouse and field for their efficacy against[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] in [$squash#Plant*].
In greenhouses, Regalia SC alone significantly (P < 0.05) reduced[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] compared to the nontreated control, and was as effective as the chemical standard Procure 480SC (triflumizole).
In alternation with Procure 480SC, Regalia SC demonstrated greater or equivalent effects on reducing the disease.
HMO 736 alone showed varying levels of disease control, but alternating with Procure 480SC significantly improved control efficacy.
In addition, application of Regalia SC or HMO 736 each in alternation with Procure 480SC significantly increased the chlorophyll content in leaves and the total fresh weight of [$squash plant#Plant*]s, when compared with the water control, Regalia SC and 11340 736 alone.
In field trials, application of Regalia SC and HMO 736 each alone significantly reduced disease severity in one of two field trials during the early stage of disease development, but not during later stages when disease pressure became high.
Both Regalia SC and HMO 736 each applied in alternation with Procure 480SC significantly improved the control efficacy compared to Procure 480SC alone.
Results from this study demonstrated that an integrated management program can be developed for[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] in [$squash #Plant*]by integrating the biopesticides Regalia SC, HMO 736 with the chemical fungicide Procure 480SC.
