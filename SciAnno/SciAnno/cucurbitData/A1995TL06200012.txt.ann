[@ Sphaerotheca fusca#Virus*] was confirmed, by the formation of cleistothecia on artificially inoculated detached cotyledons of [$melon#Plant*] in Petri dishes, as the main[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] [$pathogen#Virus*] on [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] in Crete during 1993-94.
Among 41 single-spore isolates of [$S.fusca#Virus*] from [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], [$C.melo#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] and [@Cucurbita sp.#Plant*], two races (1 and 2) were identified, in an approximately equal ratio, by using four [$melon#Plant*] differential lines.
All 41 single-spore isolates of [$S.fusca#Virus*] were grouped into two mating types, indicating that the [$fungus#Virus*] is bipolarly heterothallic and that both mating types are present in Greece.
By examining mycelial and [$conidia#Virus*]l features, one single-spore isolate of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] from [$C.pepo#Plant*] was identified as belonging to Erysiphe [$cucurbit#Virus*]acearum.
