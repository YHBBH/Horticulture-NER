Partial resistance to [@downy mildew#Virus*] ([$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*]) and complete resistance to [$powdery mildew#Disease*] ([$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*] races 1, 2 3, and 5 and Golovinonqces cichoracearum race 1) were studied using a recombinant inbred line population between 'PI 124112' (resistant to both diseases) and 'Vedrantais' (Susceptible line).
A genetic map of [$melon#Plant*] was constructed to tag these resistances with DNA markets.
Natural and artificial inoculations of [@Pseudoperonosporo cubensis#Virus*] were performed and replicated in several locations.
One major quantitative trait loci (QTL), pcXII.1.
was consistently detected among the locations and explained between 12 to 38% of the phenotypic variation for [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] resistance.
Eight other [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] resistance QTL were identified.
Artificial inoculations were performed with several strains of four races of [@Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*] and one race of [@G.cichoracearum#Virus*].
Two independent major genes, PmV.1 and PmXII.1, were identified and shown to be involved in the simple resistance to [$powdery mildew#Disease*].
Three digemc epistatic interactions involving four loci were detected for two races of [@Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]and one race of [@G.cichorocearum#Virus*].
Co-localization between PmV.1, resistance genes, and resistance genes homologues was observed.
Linkage between the major resistance QTL to [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], pcXII.1, and one of the two resistance genes to [$powdery mildew#Disease*], PmXII.1, was demonstrated.
