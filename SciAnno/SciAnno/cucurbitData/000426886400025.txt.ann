Cultivation of [@Cucumis melo#Plant*] is hampered by soil stresses.
Grafting is used to overcome these limitations.
Different [$cucurbits#Plant*] belonging to several genera have been used as rootstocks for[$ melons#Plant*]:[$ Cucurbita#Plant*], [$Lagenaria#Plant*], [$Luffa#Plant*], etc.
However, negative effects on fruit quality appear in some rootstock-scion combinations.
The selection of new resistant rootstocks that do not cause this negative impact in quality is necessary to improve [$melon#Plant*] cultivation.
In this work, we evaluated two rootstocks, closer genetically to [$melon#Plant*] scions than those usually employed: a) an F-1 hybrid between a commercial [$melon#Plant*] ([$C.melo#Plant*] subspecies melo var.
inodorus market class Piel de Sapo) and one exotic accession ([$C.melo#Plant*] subspecies agrestis var.
chinensis) with resistance to Monosporacus cannonballus, the causal agent of [$melon#Plant*] [$vine decline#Disease*], and with a certain level of tolerance to [@Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis race 1.2#Virus*], that causes [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*], and b) an accession of [$Cucumis metuliferus#Plant*], highly resistant to [$M.cannonballus#Virus*], [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]1.2 and evaluated and classified as highly resistant to [@Meloidogyne spp.#Virus*]
in this work.
Grafting compatibility of these two selected genotypes with commercial[$ melons#Plant*] was good.
All grafted plants displayed higher vigour and earlier flowering than ungrafted plants.
Fruits from plants grafted onto [$C.metuliferus#Plant*] showed similar quality than those from ungrafted/selfgrafted plants.
However, fruits from plants grafted onto the F1 (inodorus x chinensis) had in this experiment lower brix degree than the ungrafted controls.
The resistance to soil borne [$pathogens#Virus*] found in [$C.metuliferus#Plant*] and the good performance regarding plant development and fruit quality of the scions indicate that this species is a promising rootstock for[$ melons#Plant*].
