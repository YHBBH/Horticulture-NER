Grafting is becoming more popular in [@cucurbit crop#Plant*] production for soil-borne disease control.
The correct choice of rootstock can have a vital role in the success of grafting.
An improved understanding of the genetic diversity and potential of rootstock germplasm can be expected to contribute to more efficient breeding for improved rootstocks.
[$Cucurbita spp#Plant*].
([$squash #Plant*]and [$pumpkins#Plant*]) are major sources of rootstocks for grafting [$cucumbers#Plant*],[$ melons#Plant*], and [$watermelons#Plant*].
The genetic diversity and relatedness of 25 commercial[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstock cultivars and 10 inbred lines were assessed using 80 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in this study.
Forty-one SSR loci yielded 94 polymorphic alleles, with an average of 2.29 alleles per locus.
The polymorphism information content values ranged from 0.16 to 0.60, with an average of 0.36.
[$Cluster analysis#Method*] and principal coordinate analysis showed that the majority of commercial[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstocks are interspecific hybrids, [$C.maxima#Plant*] x [$C.moschata#Plant*], and these hybrids are closely related.
By contrast, the [$C.moschata#Plant*] inbreds exhibit considerably greater genetic diversity, suggesting that they could be useful for rootstock improvement.
