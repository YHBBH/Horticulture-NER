The sixty-four cultivars of four[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] species ([$C.argyrosperma#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*], [$C.moschata#Plant*], [$C.pepo#Plant*]) were tested for field resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] caused by [$Erysiphe cichoracearum#Virus*].
 [$C.pepo#Plant*] and [@C.maxima cvs.#Plant*]
were mostly highly susceptible.
 There were substantial differences among the seven groups of [$C.pepo#Plant*] in field resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
 The least susceptible [$C.pepo#Plant*] cultivars occurred in acorn and scallop groups.
 A low level of susceptibility showed cultivars of [$C.argyrosperma#Plant*] and [$C.moschata#Plant*].
