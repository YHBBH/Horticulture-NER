The striped [$cucumber#Plant*] beetle, [$Acalymma vittatum (F.)#Virus*], and the [$spotted cucumber beetle#Virus*], [@Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber#Virus*], are important pests of [$cucurbits#Plant*] throughout Missouri.
A study was conducted that examined the effects of a black plastic mulch on the soil and plant distributions of immature and adult [$cucumber#Plant*] beetles.
[$Muskmelon#Plant*] plants were subjected to one of three treatments: mulch and herbicide, herbicide, or untreated (control).
The presence of a black plastic mulch significantly reduced the number of beetle eggs and larvae found within the top 5 cm of soil around plants.
At greater soil depths, there were no differences in egg and larval densities among treatments.
Adult [$cucumber#Plant*] beetles were most often found on the flowers of plants in all treatments.
