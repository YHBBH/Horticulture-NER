In five field trials over 3 years, control of aphid-transmitted, [@nonpersistent virus diseases#Disease*] on [$pumpkin#Plant*], caused mostly by the [$potyviruses#Virus*] [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) and [@Papaya ringspot virus type-W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), was achieved by intercropping with [$grain sorghum#Plant*], as opposed to clean tillage.
Reductions in disease incidence ranged from 43 to 96% (P < 0.05).
Surrounding, [$pumpkin#Plant*] plots with borders of [@peanut#Plant*], [$soybean#Plant*], or [$corn#Plant*] was not effective.
Borders of [$grain sorghum#Plant*] were effective, but disease control was generally less than for the intercrop treatment.
Intercropping [$soybean#Plant*] and [$peanut#Plant*] with [$pumpkin#Plant*] reduced disease incidence by 27 to 60% (P <= 0.05), but disease control generally was less than for [$grain sorghum#Plant*].
Peak periods of alate aphid immigration generally preceded virus disease outbreaks by 7 to 14 days.
However, alate landing rates, as measured in green tile traps, did not differ among treatments.
Marketable yield was not increased by the intercrop treatments, and yield was reduced by up to 50% for the intercrop treatment with [$grain sorghum#Plant*] in two trials.
The use of grass-selective herbicide applied along [$pumpkin#Plant*] rows, reduced seeding rates of the intercrops, or mowing did not alleviate the adverse effects of competition between [$pumpkin#Plant*] and the [$grain sorghum#Plant*] intercrop on yield.
