The gram-negative bacterium [@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] causes [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]) disease of [$cucurbits#Plant*], which represents a serious threat to [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] production worldwide.
To date, there are no efficient means to manage the disease, and reliable resistance sources for [$cucurbit #Plant*]germplasm are lacking.
Mineral nutrition markedly affects plant diseases.
Recently, we reported that disease severity on [$melon#Plant*] foliage and [$A.citrulli #Virus*]growth in the leaf tissue were significantly influenced by the form of nitrogen supply.
In the present study, we investigated the influence of potassium nutrition on [$BFB#Disease*] severity and [$A.citrulli #Virus*]establishment in the foliage of [$melon plants#Plant*].
Fertilization with relatively low concentrations of potassium increased these variables compared with higher potassium concentrations.
Since establishment of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]during the growing season is assumed to increase the incidence of fruit infection, the fact that mineral nutrition influences [$BFB#Disease*] incidence in the plant foliage is of particular importance.
