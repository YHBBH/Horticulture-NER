[@Cucurbit crops#Plant*] are economically important worldwide.
One of the most serious threats to [$cucurbit #Plant*]production is [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
Several resistant accessions were identified in[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata and their resistance was introgressed into[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
However, the mode of inheritance of [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$C.pepo#Plant*] presents a great challenge to attempts at introgressing resistance into elite germplasm.
The main goal of this work was to analyze the inheritance of [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance and to identify markers associated with genes conferring resistance.
An Illumina GoldenGate assay allowed us to assess polymorphism among nine [$squash #Plant*]genotypes and to discover six polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two near-isogenic lines, "True French" (susceptible to [$ZYMV#Virus*]) and Accession 381e (resistant to [$ZYMV#Virus*]).
Two F-2 and three BC1 populations obtained from crossing the [$ZYMV#Virus*]-resistant Accession 381e with two susceptible ones, the [$zucchini#Plant*] True French and the [$cocozelle#Plant*] "San Pasquale," were assayed for [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance.
Molecular analysis revealed an approximately 90% association between SNP1 and resistance, which was confirmed using High Resolution Melt (HRM) and a CAPS marker.
Co-segregation up to 72% in populations segregating for resistance was observed for two other [$SNP markers#Method*] that could be potentially linked to genes involved in resistance expression.
A functional prediction of proteins involved in the resistance response was performed on genome scaffolds containing the three SNPs of interest.
Indeed, 16 full-length [$pathogen#Virus*] recognition genes (PRGs) were identified around the three [$SNP markers#Method*].
In particular, we discovered that two nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) protein-encoding genes were located near the SNP1 marker.
The investigation of [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance in [$squash #Plant*]populations and the genomic analysis performed in this work could be useful for better directing the introgression of disease resistance into elite [$C.pepo#Plant*] germplasm.
