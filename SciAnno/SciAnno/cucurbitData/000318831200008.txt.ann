[@Cucurbits#Plant*] have been used widely to elucidate gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis.
With the recent availability of the genome sequence for the economically important [$cucurbit #Plant*][$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], sequence data became available for all genes potentially involved in GA biosynthesis for this species.
Sixteen cDNAs were cloned from root and shoot of 3-d to 7-d old [$seedlings#Plant*] and from mature seeds of [@C.sativus#Plant*].
Two cDNAs code for [@GA 7-oxidases#Gene*] ([@CsGA7ox1, and -2#Gene*]), five for [@GA 20-oxidaes#Gene*] ([@CsGA20ox1, -2, -3, -4, and -5#Gene*]), four for [@GA 3-oxidases#Gene*] ([@CsGA3ox1, -2, -3, and -4#Gene*]), and another five for [@GA 2-oxidases#Gene*] ([@CsGA2ox1, -2, -3, -4, and 5#Gene*]E).
Their enzymatic activities wre investigated by heterologous expression of the cDNAs in [$Escherichia coli#Virus*] and incubation of the cell lysates with C-14-labelled, D2-labelled, or unlabelled GA-substrates.
The two [$GA 7-oxidases#Gene*] converted GA(12)-aldehyde to GA(12) efficiently.
[$CsGA7ox1#Gene*] converted GA(12) to GA(14), to 15 alpha-hydroxyGA(12), and further to 15 alpha-hydroxyGA(14).
CsGA7ox2 converted GA(12) to its 12 alpha-hydroxylated analogue GA(111).
All five [$GA 20-oxidases#Gene*] converted GA(12) to GA(9) as a major product, and to GA(25) as a minor product.
The four [$GA 3-oxidases#Gene*] oxidized the C-19-GA GA(9) to GA(4) as the only product.
In addition, three of them ([@CsGA3ox2, -3, and -4#Gene*]) converted the C-20-GA GA(12) to GA(14).
The [$GA 2-oxidases#Gene*] [@CsGA2ox1, -2, -3, and -4#Gene*] oxidized the C-19-GAs GA(9) and GA(4) to GA(34) and GA(51), respectively.
Cs[$GA2ox2#Gene*], -3, and -4 converted GA(51) and GA(34) further to respective GA-catabolites.
In addition to C-19-GAs, [@CsGA2ox4#Gene*] also converted the C-20-GA GA(12) to GA(110).
In contrast, [@CsGA2ox5#Gene*] oxidized only the C-20 GA(12) to GA(110) as the sole product.
As shown for [@CsGA20ox1#Gene*] and [@CsGA3ox1#Gene*], similar reactions were catalysed with 13-hydroxlyated GAs as substrates.
It is likely that these enzymes are also responsible for the biosynthesis of 13-hydroxylated GAs in vivo that occur at low levels in [$cucumber#Plant*].
