The inhibitory effects of sodium, potassium, and ammonium bicarbonates (NaHCO3, KHCO3 and NH4HCO3, respectively) alone and in combination with SunSpray Ultra-Fine Spray Oil (SS) on[$ powdery mildew#Virus*], caused by [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*]; [$gummy stem blight#Disease*], caused by [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*]; [$Alternaria leaf blight#Disease*], caused by [$Alternaria cucumerina#Virus*]; and Ulocladium leaf spot, caused by Ulocladium [$cucurbitae#Plant*], were studied.
 SS oil performed consistently better than ForEverGreen, Masbrane, Crop Life, Vapor Gard, Nu-Film 17, and Bio-Film for[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] control in [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*].
 NaHCO3 or KHCO3 combined with SS oil, both at 0.5%, were more effective treatments for[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] on [$pumpkin#Plant*] than either of the materials used alone, whereas NH4HCO3 was ineffective.
 All three bicarbonates (1% w/v) plus SS oil (1% v/v), and especially NH4HCO3 + SS, provided good control of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] and [$Alternaria leaf blight#Disease*] of [$muskmelon#Plant*] and Ulocladium leaf spot of [$cucumber#Plant*] in greenhouse trials.
 The bicarbonate-plus-oil treatments were more effective when applied prior to inoculation.
 KHCO3 was phytotoxic to mildew-infected [$pumpkin#Plant*] leaves at concentrations greater than 0.5%; NaHCO3 caused minimal injury, and NH4HCO3 caused no injury.
 Similar results were obtained when bicarbonate solutions were applied to punctured [$cucumber#Plant*] cotyledons.
 In vitro studies showed that bicarbonate salts inhibited growth of these organisms and [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], causal [$fungus#Virus*] of [$cucurbit #Plant*][$anthracnose#Virus*].
 NH4HCO3 was most inhibitory.
 Na, K, and NH4 chloride salts were least inhibitory.
