A number of [@cucurbits#Plant*] are mentioned and described in Mediterranean writings of the first and second centuries CE, including Dioscorides' De Materia Medica, Columella's De Re Rustica, Pliny's Historia Naturalis, and the codices of Jewish law known as the Mishna and Tosefta.
Images of [$cucurbits#Plant*] from the same region pre-dating, contemporary, or somewhat later than these writings appear to represent the same [@cucurbit taxa#Plant*].
Based on a reconciling of these texts and images it is clear that the [$cucumis#Plant*] described by Columella and Pliny and grown in proto-greenhouses of the Roman Emperor Tiberius was the same as the qishu' in mentioned in the codices of Jewish law and are here identified taxonomically as [@Cucumis melo subsp.melo#Plant*] Flexuosus Group, known today as [$snake melon#Plant*], [$vegetable melon#Plant*], and faqqous.
We found no evidence, descriptive or illustrative, for the presence of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], in Mediterranean Cultures during this time period, despite the re[$pea#Plant*]ted translations of [$cucumis#Plant*] and sikyos hemeros as [$cucumber#Plant*] by translators of these ancient documents.
