[@Bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) is an important [$vegetable#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] as well as a rootstock for other [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
In this study, we report a high-quality 313.4-Mb genome sequence of a [$bottle gourd#Plant*] inbred line, USVL1VR-Ls, with a scaffold N50 of 8.7 Mb and the longest of 19.0 Mb.
About 98.3% of the assembled scaffolds are anchored to the 11 pseudomolecules.
Our comparative genomic analysis identifies chromosome-level syntenic relationships between [$bottle gourd#Plant*] and other [$cucurbits#Plant*], as well as lineage-specific gene family expansions in [$bottle gourd#Plant*].
We reconstructed the genome of the most recent common ancestor of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae, which revealed that the ancestral[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae karyotypes consisted of 12 protochromosomes with 18534 protogenes.
The 12 protochromosomes are largely retained in the modern [$melon#Plant*] genome, while have undergone different degrees of shuffling events in other investigated [$cucurbit #Plant*]genomes.
The 11 [$bottle gourd#Plant*] chromosomes derive from the ancestral[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae karyotypes followed by 19 chromosomal fissions and 20 fusions.
The [$bottle gourd#Plant*] genome sequence has facilitated the mapping of a dominant monogenic locus, Prs, conferring [@Papaya ring-spot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) resistance in [$bottle gourd#Plant*], to a 317.8-kb region on chromosome 1.
We have developed a [$cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker#Method*] tightly linked to the Prs locus and demonstrated its potential application in marker-assisted selection of [$PRSV#Virus*] resistance in [$bottle gourd#Plant*].
This study provides insights into the paleohistory of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae genome evolution, and the high-quality genome sequence of [$bottle gourd#Plant*] provides a useful resource for plant comparative genomics studies and [$cucurbit #Plant*]improvement.
