   Field surveys were conducted from 2008 to 2010 to detect and determine the incidence of viruses in the major cucurbit-growing areas of Oklahoma.
In total, 1,049 symptomatic leaf samples (890 from [@cucurbits#Plant*], 109 from [$weed#Plant*] species, and 50 from [$crop#Plant*] plants [agricultural [$crops#Plant*]]) were collected from 90 fields in four counties (Atoka, Blaine, Jefferson, and Tulsa) of Oklahoma.
Samples were tested against seven viruses, including [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]), [$Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*]-[$watermelon#Plant*] strain ([$PRSV-W#Virus*], formerly known as [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*]-I), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus-2 #Virus*]([$WMV-2#Virus*]), and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [@using dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA)#Method*].
Results showed the highest incidence for [$PRSV#Virus*] (51%), followed by [$WMV-2#Virus*] (14%) and [$ZYMV#Virus*] (10%) among the collected samples.
[$SqMV#Virus*], [$MNSV#Virus*], and [$CMV#Virus*] were detected in 3.8, 3.3, and 1.1% of the samples, respectively.
None of the samples collected during surveys reacted positively against the antiserum of [$CGMMV#Virus*].
Mixed virus infections were common involving two (5.18%) or three (4.61%) viruses in various combinations.
New [$weed#Plant*] host species were found to be infected with [$PRSV#Virus*] when confirmed by both DIBA and [$reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]).
Some [$weed#Plant*] species contained possible new viruses when analyzed by [@random RT-PCR, followed by cloning, sequencing, and BLAST analysis with sequences in GenBank#Method*].
