The infectious full-length cDNA clone of z[@ucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) isolate PA ([@pZYMV-PA#Virus*]), which was isolated from [$pumpkin#Plant*], was constructed by utilizing viral transcription and processing signals to produce infectious in vivo transcripts.
Simple rub-inoculation of plasmid DNAs of [$pZYMV-PA#Virus*] was successful to cause infection of [$zucchini#Plant*] plants ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]).
We further engineered this infectious cDNA clone of [$ZYMV#Virus*] as a viral vector for systemic expression of heterologous proteins in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
We successfully expressed two reporter genes including gfp, and bar in [$zucchini#Plant*] plants by simple rub-inoculation of plasmid DNAs of the [$ZYMV#Virus*]-based expression constructs.
Our method of the [$ZYMV#Virus*]-based viral vector in association with the simple rub inoculation provides an easy and rapid approach for introduction and evaluation of heterologous genes in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
