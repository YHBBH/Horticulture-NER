P>Based on the high density of plasmodesmata interconnecting the intermediary cells and their neighboring phloem parenchyma or bundle-sheath cells, and based on the insensitivity to the sucrose transport inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS), cucurbits have been concluded to be symplastic loaders.
In the present study, we identified and characterized the full-length sequence of [@sucrose transporter gene#Gene*] ([@CmSUT1#Gene*]) from [$melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo L.cv.Hale's best jumbo#Plant*]).
In vitro experiments confirmed that the identified gene product has suc[$rose#Plant*] transporter activity in baker's yeast.
Healthy and [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*])-infected [$melon plants#Plant*] were employed to examine suc[$rose#Plant*] transporter activity in planta.
Pretreatment with PCMBS inhibited loading of newly fixed 14CO(2) into minor veins of [$CMV#Virus*]-infected plants.
Moreover, [$CMV#Virus*] infection caused significant increase in [$CmSUT1#Gene*] transcripts expression, mainly in vascular bundles of minor veins, which was associated with elevated sucrose content in phloem sap collected from source-leaf petioles.
We propose that [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] contain the machinery for apoplastic phloem loading and that [$CMV#Virus*] infection causes a quantitative shift in the mode by which photoassimilates are loaded into the sieve tube.
