[@Cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] ([$CDM#Disease*]), caused by the obligate oomycete [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*], has resurged around the world during the past three decades.
A new pathotype or genetic recombinant of [$P cubensis#Virus*] have been suggested as possible reasons for the resurgence of [$CDM#Disease*] in the United States in 2004.
In total, 22 isolates collected between 2004 and 2014, mainly in the eastern United States, were tested for their compatibility with a set of 15 [$cucurbit #Plant*]host types.
The virulence structure within these isolates was evaluated on a set of 12 differential genotypes from eight genera.
All isolates were highly compatible with the susceptible cultivar of [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], whereas the least compatibility was observed with [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] and [$Momordica charantia#Plant*].
Based on the compatibility with the differential host set, five pathotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, and 6) were identified among the 22 isolates examined.
Pathotypes 1 and 3 had not been previously described in the United States and isolates of these two new pathotypes were also compatible with Poinsett 76', a cultivar of [$C.sativus#Plant*] known to be resistant to [$CDM#Disease*] prior to 2004.
Virulence within the [$pathogen#Virus*] population was expressed based on virulence factors, virulence phenotypes, and virulence complexity.
The number of virulence factors ranged from two to eight, indicating a complex virulence structure, with 77% of the isolates having five to eight virulence factors.
Thirteen virulence phenotypes were identified; the mean number of virulence factors per isolate and mean number of virulence factors per virulence phenotype was 5.05 and 5.23, respectively, indicating that complex isolates and phenotypes contributed equally to the complex virulence structure of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
Gleason and Shannon indices of diversity were 3.88 and 2.32, respectively, indicating a diverse virulence structure of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]within the United States population.
The diverse virulence and high virulence complexity within the [$pathogen#Virus*] population indicate that host resistance alone in available [$cucurbit cultivar#Plant*]s will not be effective to control [$CDM#Disease*].
An integrated approach involving a combination of fungicide application and introduction of cultivars with new resistance genes will be required for effective management of [$CDM#Disease*].
