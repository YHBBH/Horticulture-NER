 Under controlled inoculation, six [@muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) lines were studied for resistance to eight isolates of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] ([$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*] (Berk.and Curt.) Rostow.) originating from [$cucumbers#Plant*] ([@Cucumis staivus L.#Plant*]).
 Only line MR-1 was highly resistant with expression of race specificity and genetic heterogeneity.
 This line was also resistant to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*] (Schlecht.
ex Fr.) Poll.) under glasshouse and laboratory conditions.
