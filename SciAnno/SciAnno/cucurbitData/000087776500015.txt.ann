The French botanist/horticulturist A.N.
Duchesne was the first to conduct an in-depth taxonomic study of the genus[@ Cucurbita#Plant*].
This study was based on the results of cross-pollination and was conducted from 1768 until 1774.
The results were presented as a reading from a manuscript accompanied by drawings, most of them life-like watercolors, before the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1779.
The original manuscript has been lost but several brief summaries are scattered in various libraries.
The drawings, housed at a museum in Paris, France, are mostly of mature fruits.
Most are of [$C.pepo#Plant*] and include the earliest known drawings of [$cocozelle#Plant*] and [$straightneck#Plant*] [$squash #Plant*]whilst several are of [@C.moschata#Plant*] and [$C.maxima#Plant*].
