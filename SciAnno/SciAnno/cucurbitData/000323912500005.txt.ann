The incidence and distribution of [@Tobacco mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$TMV#Virus*]) and related [$tobamoviruses#Virus*] was determined using an [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] on 1,926 symptomatic [$horticultural crops#Plant*] and 107 asymptomatic [$weed#Plant*] samples collected from 78 highly infected fields in the major horticultural [$crop#Plant*]-producing areas in 17 provinces throughout Iran.
The results were confirmed by [@host range studies#Method*] and [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*].
The overall incidence of infection by these viruses in symptomatic plants was 11.3%.
The [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene sequences of a number of isolates were determined and disclosed to be a high identity (up to 100%) among the Iranian isolates.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of all known [$TMV#Virus*] [$CP#Gene*] genes showed three clades on the basis of nucleotide sequences with all Iranian isolates distinctly clustered in clade II.
Analysis using the complete [$CP#Gene*] amino acid sequence showed one clade with two subgroups, IA and IB, with Iranian isolates in both subgroups.
The nucleotide diversity within each subgroup was very low, but higher between the two clades.
No correlation was found between genetic distance and geographical origin or host species of isolation.
Statistical analyses suggested a negative selection and demonstrated the occurrence of gene flow from the isolates in other clades to the Iranian population.
