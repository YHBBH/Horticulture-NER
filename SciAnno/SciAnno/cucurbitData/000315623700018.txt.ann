[@Downy mildew (DM) of cucumber#Disease*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]), caused by [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*], is a devastating disease of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Resistance is available but is not sufficient to eliminate the need for fungicides to control the disease.
Previously, the USDA Plant Introduction collection of [$cucumber#Plant*] germplasm was screened in Poland and North Carolina, and Ames 2354 was identified as highly resistant.
The objectives of this study were to develop an effective method for measuring resistance to DM and to determine the type of gene action controlling resistance in Ames 2354.
Plant Introduction 175695 was used as the susceptible parent in crosses with Ames 2354 to make seven generations for study: P-1, P-2, F-1, F-1 reciprocal, F-2, BC1P1, and BC1P2.
Additive effects were more important than dominant effects in our study with resistance attributed to a few major loci.
[@Greenhouse testing methods#Method*] were identified that can be used in selecting for improved resistance.
Selection using the best test methods could lead to a gain of at least 2.5 points (on a 10 point scale) per generation even under the lower selection intensities (i.e., 20%) typically used in recurrent selection programs.
