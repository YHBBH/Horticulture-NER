Two secondary compounds of the genus [@Cucumis#Plant*], pyrazole and beta(pyrazol-l-yl)L-alanine (beta PA), were found and measured in the phloem sap of [$melon#Plant*].
The effects of these compounds on attractivity, growth inhibition and mortality were tested on aphids from [$cucurbit#Plant*] and non[$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts.
beta PA had no noticeable effect on the [$aphids tested#Method*].
In contrast, pyrazole had highly deleterious effects on [$Acyrthosiphon pisum#Virus*], which does not feed on [$melon#Plant*].
In addition, the strain of Aphis [@gossypii#Plant*] which is adapted to [$melon#Plant*] appeared to be much more tolerant to pyrazole than the [$cotton#Plant*] strain of the same species.
Both strains of A.
[$gossypii#Plant*] were stimulated to feed by moderate concentrations of pyrazole, whereas A.
[@pisum#Plant*] was not.
The resistance to A.
[$gossypii#Plant*] due to the [@Vat#Gene*] gene in [$melon#Plant*] cannot be explained by the distribution of pyrazoles in the two susceptible/resistant lines tested: beta PA was present in these two lines at comparable levels and pyrazole at levels too low to mediate any behavioural effect.
