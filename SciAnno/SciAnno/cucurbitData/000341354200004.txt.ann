Three fruit flies ([@Diptera#Virus*] : [$Tephritidae#Virus*]) damage [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] on Reunion Island : [$Bactrocera cucurbitae #Plant*]([$Coquillet#Virus*]), [$Dacus demmerezi#Virus*] ([@Bezzi#Virus*]) and [@D.ciliatus#Virus*] ([@Loew#Virus*]).
Chemical control does not provide any satisfactory control of fly populations.
The GAMOUR project aims at promoting agroecological management of these pests.
The present work is aimed at studying the augmentative releases of the parasitoid [@Psyttalia fletcheri (Silvestri)#Virus*] ([$Hymenoptera#Virus*] : [@Braconidae#Virus*]) as a biological control agent.
From 2010 to 2011, four trials were set up.
We released between 1,600 to 3,000 parasitoid wasps according to the trial.
The parasitism rate of P.fletcheri was then recorded using fruit samples collected in the field.
Parasitism was almost null before the releases.
After the releases, mean parasitism rates increased moderately with a maximum of 16.7%.
The parasitism was moreover null on [$crops#Plant*] where no B.[$cucurbitae#Plant*] were caught.
In light of a cost-benefit analysis, releases of [@P.fletcheri#Virus*] appear therefore irrelevant.
On the other hand, inoculative releases of parasitoids in low altitude agrosystems ([@B.cucurbitae#Virus*] is present below 800 m) could locally increase the abundance of wasps and promote environmentally friendly methods to growers.
