[@Tospoviruses#Virus*] are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe damage to various economically important [$crops#Plant*] in Thailand and worldwide.
[$Tospoviruses#Virus*] are transmitted by several species of thrips.
In Thailand, four [$tospovirus#Virus*] species including [$Capsicum chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$CaCV#Virus*]), [$Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] ([$MYSV#Virus*]), [@Tomato necrotic ringspot virus#Virus*] ([@TNRV#Virus*]) and [$Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] ([$WSMoV#Virus*]) have been identified in [$tomato#Plant*], [$pepper#Plant*] and [$cucurbit #Plant*]production fields so far.
In this study, we conducted a survey to determine the occurrence and distribution of [$tospoviruses#Virus*] and their thrips vectors collected from [$tomato#Plant*] fields in several regions of Thailand during December 2011 to April 2015.
[$Tomato#Plant*] plant samples exhibiting [$tospovirus#Virus*]-like symptoms (n=385) were screened for [$tospoviruses#Virus*] using a plate-trapped antigen [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$PTA-ELISA#Method*]).
[$RT-PCR#Method*] was performed on [$ELISA#Method*]-positive samples (n=121) using primers specific to the [$nucleocapsid protein#Gene*] (N) genes of [$CaCV#Virus*], [$MYSV#Virus*], [$TNRV#Virus*] and [$WSMoV#Virus*].
N[$ gene#Method*] sequencing was conducted in some samples for confirmation.
Thrips collected from [$tomato#Plant*] fields were identified to the species level based on morphological characteristics (n=700).
Our results showed that [$TNRV#Virus*] (44.6%) and [$CaCV#Virus*] (35.5%) were the two major [$tospoviruses#Virus*] detected in the examined [$tomato#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*], while a low incidence of [$WSMoV#Virus*] infection (1.7%) was found.
Mixed infections of [$CaCV#Virus*] and [$TNRV#Virus*] (16.6%), [$CaCV#Virus*] and [$MYSV#Virus*] (0.8%), and [$CaCV#Virus*], [$TNRV#Virus*] and [$WSMoV#Virus*] (0.8%) were also observed.
All thrips found in the [$tomato#Plant*] fields were identified as [@Ceratothripoides claratris#Virus*].
[@Thrips transmission assay#Method*] confirmed that [@C.claratris#Virus*] was able to transmit [$CaCV#Virus*] and [$TNRV#Virus*] with efficiencies of 70 and 12%, respectively.
