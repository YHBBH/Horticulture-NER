A novel whitefly-transmitted member of the family [@Potyviridae#Virus*] was isolated from a [@squash plant#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) with [@vein yellowing symptoms#Disease*] in Florida.
The virus, for which the name [@Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([@SqVYV#Virus*]) is proposed, has flexuous rod-shaped particles of 840 nm in length.
The experimental host range was limited to species in the [@family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], with the most dramatic symptoms observed in [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*], but excluded all tested species in the [@families Amaranthaceae#Plant*], [@Apocynaceae#Plant*], [@Asteraceae#Plant*], [@Chenopodiaceac#Plant*], [@Fabaceae#Plant*], [$Malvaceae#Plant*], and [@Solanaceae#Plant*].
The virus was transmitted by [$whiteflies#Virus*] ([@Bemisia tobaci#Virus*]) but was not transmitted by [$aphids#Virus*] ([@Myzus persicae#Virus*]).
Infection by [$SqVYV#Virus*] induced inclusion bodies visible by electron and light microscopy that were characteristic of members of the [$family Potyviridae#Virus*].
Comparison of the [$SqVYV#Virus*] [$coat protein gene#Gene*] and protein sequences with those of recognized members of the [$family Potyviridae#Virus*] indicate that it is a novel member of the genus Ipomoviru.
A limited survey revealed that [$SqVYV#Virus*] also was present in [$watermelon#Plant*] plants suffering from a [$vine#Plant*] [$decline#Disease*] and fruit rot recently observed in Florida and was sufficient to induce these symptoms in greenhouse-grown [$watermelon#Plant*], suggesting that [$SqVYV#Virus*] is the likely cause of this disease.
