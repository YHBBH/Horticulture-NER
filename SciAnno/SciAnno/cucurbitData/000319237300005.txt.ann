Three [@Monosporascus eutypoides#Virus*]-like isolates recovered from [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] with symptoms of [@Monosporascus root rot#Disease*] and [$vine decline#Disease*] in Tunisia were compared to 28 isolates of [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] from 12 countries for phenotypic, genomic, and [$pathogenicity#Plant*] characteristics.
Morphologically, [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] and [@M.eutypoides#Virus*]-like cultures were similar, each producing fertile perithecia in culture containing globose, smooth, dark brown to black ascospores.
Nevertheless, all [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] isolates had one ascospore per ascus, while [$M.eutypoides#Virus*]-like isolates had mainly two to three ascospores per ascus (rarely one).
The employment of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, the elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1 alpha), and the beta-tubulin (beta-tub) gene sequence diversity analyses and the resulting phylogenies identified a level of polymorphism that enabled separation of [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] and [$M.eutypoides#Virus*]-like isolates.
All isolates of [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] had identical EF-1 alpha and beta-tub sequences irrespective of very diverse geographic origins, which were different from the EF-1 alpha and beta-tub sequences of the [$M.eutypoides#Virus*]-like isolates (96 and 97% similarity, respectively).
Similar results were obtained for the ITS region of rDNA.
In addition, of three [$M.eutypoides#Virus*]-like isolates tested for [$pathogenicity#Plant*], all three were [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on [$watermelon#Plant*], two were [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on [$muskmelon#Plant*], but only one was [$pathogen#Virus*]ic on [$cucumber#Plant*].
The results demonstrate that the [$M.eutypoides#Virus*] like isolates belong to the species [$M.eutypoides#Virus*], and that [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] and [$M.eutypoides#Virus*] are distinct species.
