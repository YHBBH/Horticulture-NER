Temporal changes in the pathogenicity and fungicide resistance of populations of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] ([$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*]) in the Czech Republic from 2001 to 2003 were observed.
Altogether, 152 [@P cubensis#Virus*] isolates collected from [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] in 10 Czech regions were analysed for pathogenic variation, 74 of which were used for fungicide resistance screening.
The data on changes in pathogenicity, as expressed by [$pathogen#Virus*] pathotypes, exemplified well the process of micro-evolutionary shift in [$pathogen#Virus*] populations.
During the period studied, there was a considerable increase of [$pathogenicity#Plant*] that was expressed by a higher complexity of pathotypes and their increasing frequency.
However, the diversity of the [$pathogen#Virus*] populations in general decreased.
A similar phenomenon was observed in fungicide (metalaxyl, phosetyl-Al, propamocarb) effectiveness, which varied considerably.
Propamocarb was the most effective, but metalaxyl was ineffective and resistance to this fungicide was fixed in the [$pathogen#Virus*] populations.
For phosetyl-Al, there was observed evidence of the start of selection for higher resistance in the [$P cubensis#Virus*] populations.
It is concluded that [$P cubensis#Virus*] could be considered as a population with a high evolutionary potential that is capable of quickly overcoming host resistance and the effectivity of some fungicides.
The data are discussed from the viewpoint of integrated [$crop#Plant*] management.
