Samples of [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] plants with foliar yellowing and curling symptoms were collected in Komae City (Japan) in 2011 and shown by Southern blot hybridization to be associated with a [$begomovirus#Virus*].
[@Rolling circle amplification and PCR-mediated amplification with specific primers#Method*] showed the presence of a [$begomovirus#Virus*] and an alphasatellite, but neither a DNA-B component or a betasatellite.
[@Sequence analysis of full-length clones#Method*] showed the virus to be an isolate of the Israel strain of [$Tomato yellow leaf curl virus#Virus*] and the alphasatellite Sida yellow vein China alphasatellite.
This is the first identification of these components in a [$cucurbit #Plant*]in Japan.
