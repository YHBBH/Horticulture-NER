[@Melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) is an excellent model species for the Study of functional genomics in the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], a plant family that includes [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*].
[$watermelon#Plant*], and [$squash#Plant*], because Of its unique traits such as a lianous structure of the plant body and unusual mode of sex determination.
Following the first workshop on [$Cucurbit#Plant*] genomics in Barcelona in 2005, the International [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Initiative (ICuGI: http://www.icugi.org/) was established at an academic level, and [$melon#Plant*] became the model Species for [$cucurbit #Plant*]stud as a result of existing genomic resources for this species.
The ICuGI is currently overseeing three projects concerned with the development of research tools for functional genomics in [$melon#Plant*]: sequencing of ESTs, merging of existing [$melon#Plant*] genetic maps, and development of an ICuGI webpage containing specific genomic tools available to the [$cucurbit #Plant*]research community.
Additional efforts are also underway to develop tools for the study of [$melon#Plant*] functional genomics.
Availability of these resources will promote research activities in the[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae, especially [$melon#Plant*].
This review summarizes the current status of these tools and discusses future aspects of the study of [$melon#Plant*] functional genomics.
