Low-cost methods for enhancement of seed longevity may facilitate biodiversity conservation especially in resource constrained situations.
Longevity of 13 cucurbitaceous seed lots belonging lo 12 species with mean moisture contents 9.3 +/- 0.7% was studied in hermetic storage (HS) and in a liquid consisting of 20% (w/w) CaCl2 in glycerol, following seed to preservative ratio of 1:1 (v/v), at ambient temperature for 24 years-The liquid preservative (LP) was not absorbed by the seeds over the storage period and was harmless to them, drying seeds to about 5% of moisture and maintaining them at this state throughout tire storage period.
Tire seeds lost viability in HS in 3.8 +/- 0.4 years, while in LP viability was lost in 14-lb years in eight species and the seeds were still viable in five species after 24 years.
LP-preserved seeds and also fresh seeds of three species were planted under field conditions.
The results validated the use of LP in seed storage for 24 years.
The liquid preservation extended longevity of the cucurbit seeds at ambient temperature by drying them and probably maintaining them in oxygen-free environment.
