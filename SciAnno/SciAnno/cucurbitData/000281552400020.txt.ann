To better understand the genetic diversity of cucurbit-infecting poleroviruses in Taiwan, a survey was conducted in 2008 and 2009 as a prelude to screening germplasm for resistance.
Out of 102 cucurbit samples showing yellowing symptoms collected across eight counties, 29 were identified as infected by polerovirus(es) by [@reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a set of universal polerovirus primers#Method*].
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] of a 1.4-kb [$PCR#Method*] product spanning part of the [@RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene#Gene*], the intergenic region (IR) and the complete [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene of 13 of the 29 samples revealed the presence of three distinct [$Polerovirus#Virus*] species, namely [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), [@Melon aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([@MABYV#Virus*]) and [@Suakwa aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([@SABYV#Virus*]).
In addition to the common strain of [$CABYV#Virus*] ([@CABYV-C#Virus*]) a recombinant strain of [$CABYV#Virus*] ([@CABYV-R#Virus*]) was identified.
The recombinant strain probably arose by recombination in the IR, a recombination hot-spot of poleroviruses, between ancestors of [$MABYV#Virus*] and [$CABYV-C#Virus*].
[$RT-PCR#Method*] protocols based on sets of specific primers were developed to distinguish between the different [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting polerovirus species and the two [$CABYV#Virus*] strains.
These findings are discussed in relation to strategies for breeding for durable resistance against poleroviruses.
