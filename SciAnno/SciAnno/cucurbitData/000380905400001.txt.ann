In our previous efforts to understand the regulatory mechanisms of [$cucumber#Plant*] unisexual flower development, we observed a stamen-specific down-regulation of the ethylene receptor [@CsETR1#Gene*] in stage 6 female flowers of [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]).
This down-regulation is correlated with the primordial anther-specific DNA damage that characterizes inappropriate stamen development in [$cucumber#Plant*] female flowers.
To understand how [@CsETR1#Gene*] is down regulated in the stamen, we characterized a [$cucumber#Plant*] MADS box gene homologous to [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] A[$P3#Gene*], [@CsAP3#Gene*].
We demonstrated that [$CsAP3#Gene*] is functionally equivalent to the [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] B-class MADS gene A[$P3#Gene*].
However, three novel characteristics of [$CsAP3#Gene*] were found.
These include firstly, binding and activating [$CsETR1#Gene*] promoter in vitro and in vivo; secondly, containing a GV repeat in its C-terminus, which is conserved in [$cucurbits#Plant*] and required for the transcription activation; and thirdly, decreased expression as the node number increases, which is similar to that found for [$CsETR1#Gene*].
These findings revealed not only the conserved function of [$CsAP3#Gene*] as a B-class floral identity gene, but also its unique functions in regulation of female flower development in [$cucumber#Plant*].
