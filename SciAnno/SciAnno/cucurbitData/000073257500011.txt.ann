Since 1991, a new disease of [@cucurbits#Plant*] in central Texas and Oklahoma, designated [$yellow vine#Disease*], has resulted in the decline and plant death of [$watermelon#Plant*], [@cantaloupe.
squash#Plant*], and [@pumpkin#Plant*].
Affected plants are characterized by leaf yellowing, phloem discoloration, and plant collapse.
Year-to-year variation in disease incidence has ranged from spotty outbreaks to complete [$crop#Plant*] loss in early-planted [$watermelon#Plant*] fields.
A systematic investigation to determine the causal agent of the disease included pathogen isolation attempts, transmission test, [@serological assays with various antisera (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method* and [@Western blotting#Method*]), and [@DNA hybridizations with selected probes#Method*] ([@dot and Southern blots#Method*]).
None of these tests revealed a consistent relationship between the expression of [$yellow vine#Disease*] symptoms and the presence of a particular microorganism or virus in the plant.
However, [@transmission electron microscopic examination#Method*] showed the consistent presence of a [@bacteriuin#Virus*] the phloem sieve elements of symptomatic plants.
The rod-shaped bacteria, observed only in symptomatic [$cucurbits#Plant*], measured 0.25 to 0.5 mu m in width and 1.0 to 3.0 mu m in length and were surrounded by a triple-layered cell envelope.
