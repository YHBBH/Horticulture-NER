Most cultivars of tropical [@pumpkin#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita moschata Duchesne#Plant*]) are large, trailing plants.
New semi-bush (SB) genotypes need to be tested against traditional long [$vine#Plant*] (LV) types.
Both types of [$pumpkin#Plant*] have large amounts of interplant space during the early stages of growth that might allow for the planting of an inter[$crop#Plant*].
To test this hypothesis, as well as the performance of tropical [$pumpkins#Plant*] of varying growth habit, double rows of [$beans#Plant*] ([@Phaseolus vulgaris L.#Plant*]) or [$cowpeas#Plant*] [[@Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.#Plant*]] were inter[$crop#Plant*]ped between rows of SB or traditional LV tropical [$pumpkin#Plant*] in Spring and Fall 1993 in Lajas and Isabela, Puerto Rico.
In general, interactions between inter[$crop#Plant*] treatment and [$pumpkin#Plant*] genotype were not significant.
At its maximum percentage cover (MC) the LV genotype covered, or nearly covered, the entire plot while the SB genotype covered 50% of the plot or less.
The SB [$pumpkin#Plant*] was harvested 5 to 27 days earlier than the LV type.
Yield was two to 12 times greater, and average fruit size three to six times greater in the latter.
Planting of an inter[$crop#Plant*] did not reduce [$pumpkin#Plant*] yield.
Green-shelled yields of inter[$crop#Plant*]ped legumes averaged approximate to700 kg(.)ha(-1).
Genotype of the [$pumpkin#Plant*] main[$crop#Plant*] did not affect[@ legume#Plant*] green-shelled yields in Lajas.
In Isabela,[$ legume#Plant*] green-shelled yields were 50% higher in SB than in LV [$pumpkin#Plant*] plots.
Legume dry grain yields were greatly reduced in LV compared to SB plots.
Inter[$crop#Plant*]ping of tropical [$pumpkin#Plant*] with a short season[$ legume#Plant*] that can be harvested green-shelled is an efficient inter[$crop#Plant*]ping system that offers additional yield from the[$ legume#Plant*] without sacrificing yield from the [$pumpkin#Plant*] main[$crop#Plant*].
Both SB and LV [$pumpkins#Plant*] can be used in an inter[$crop#Plant*] system, but [$pumpkin#Plant*] yields were much greater with the LV genotype.
