The biofungicide AQ10, a pelleted formulation of conidia of [@Ampelomyces quisqualis#Virus*], did not significantly reduce the size of colonies of the [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*]) in detached [$squash #Plant*]leaf culture but did reduce the amount of inoculum produced by each colony.
No significant reduction in colonization of [@powdery mildew#Disease*] colonies by AQ10 was observed when it was sprayed in conjunction with the fungicides myclobutanil at 10 mug/ml or triadimefon at 100 mug/ml, suggesting that it is not sensitive to the fungicides at these concentrations.
The spray adjuvant AddQ did not increase percent colonization by [@A.quisqualis#Virus*] but reduced the size of [$mildew colonies#Virus*] when used alone or with AQ10.
