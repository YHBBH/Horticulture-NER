A survey of viruses in the major [@cucurbit#Plant*]-growing areas of 17 provinces in Tran was conducted in 2005 and 2006.
A total of 1699 leaf samples were collected from [$melon#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] plants showing various virus-like symptoms.
Screening for 11 [$cucurbit viruses#Virus*] by double-antibody sandwich [$ELISA#Method*] ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]) or [$RT-PCR#Method*], found that 71% of the samples were infected by at least one virus, of which [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) was the most common overall, occurring in 49, 47, 40, and 33% of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*] samples respectively.
The second most common virus on [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] was [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) (incidence 30-33%); on [$cucumber#Plant*], [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*])(33%); and on [$squash#Plant*], [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*])(38%).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of [$Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]) and [@Zucchini yellow fleck virus#Virus*] ([$ZYFV#Virus*]) in Iran.
Mixed infections Occurred in 49% of symptomatic samples.
Mixed infections were relatively frequent in [$squash #Plant*](58%) and [$melon#Plant*] (55%).
The most frequent double infections were [$WMV#Virus*]+[$CABYV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*]+[$CABYV#Virus*] in [$melon#Plant*], [$squash #Plant*]and [$cucumber#Plant*], followed by [$WMV#Virus*]+[$ZYMV#Virus*].
In [$watermelon#Plant*], the most frequent double infection was [$WMV#Virus*]+[$ZYMV#Virus*], followed by [$WMV#Virus*]+[$CABYV#Virus*].
The high frequency of [$CABYV#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] in the samples assayed on all four [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] and in all areas surveyed, as well as the detection of [$Watermelon#Plant*] [$chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([@WmCSV#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) in northern and Southern Iran, suggest that these viruses represent a potential threat to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Iran.
