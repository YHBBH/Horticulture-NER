Interspecific hybrid [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita maxima #Plant*]x C+ moschara 'Strong Tosa') and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([@Lagenaria siceraria 'Macis'#Plant*]) rootstocks are resistant to [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] but susceptible to [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*] (Southern [$root-knot nematode#Virus*]).
Coinfection of Early Prolific Straightneck[$ summer squash#Plant*] ([$C.pepo#Plant*]) with [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] and [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] has been reported to increase susceptibility to [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*].
The objectives of this study were to determine whether such an interaction occurred between [$M.incognita#Virus*] and [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] races I and 2 on Strong Tosa, Macis, and [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*] Fascination (resistant to race 1) and Tri-X 313 (susceptible to both races).
Hosts were inoculated in a greenhouse with one of four [$pathogen#Virus*] treatments: [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*], [$M.incognita#Virus*], both [$pathogens#Virus*], or neither [$pathogen#Virus*].
Galling was present on >= 10% of the root systems of 90% of the plants inoculated with M.
incognita.
[$Bottle gourd#Plant*] had less galling than interspecific hybrid [$squash#Plant*].
Plants not inoculated with [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] did not wilt.
Four weeks after inoculation, incidence and severity of [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] and recovery of [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]did not differ for any hosts inoculated with [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] alone and [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]f, sp.niveum plus [$M.incognita#Virus*] (host treatment interactions not significant).
In general, Early Prolific Straightneck grouped with the [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*]-resistant rootstocks when inoculated with [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum race 2#Virus*] and with the susceptible [$watermelon#Plant*] when inoculated with race 1, regardless of inoculation with [$M.incognita#Virus*].
Recovery of F.
oxysporum from stems of inoculated [$watermelon#Plant*] was greater than recovery from the other three hosts, regardless of nematode inoculation.
In conclusion, our experiments do not support the hypothesis that resistance to [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] in [$cucurbit #Plant*][$rootstocks#Plant*] or resistant [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*] would be compromised when [$M.incognita#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]cts the roots.
