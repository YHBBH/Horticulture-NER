[@Poleroviruses#Virus*] are not mechanically transmittable by sap inoculation, which makes their isolation and multiplication in laboratory hosts for virion extraction and genome [$sequence analysis#Method*] difficult.
A [$reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) procedure was modified to amplify the entire genomes of [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting poleroviruses in three sections directly from RNA extracts from infected plant field samples.
The procedure was used to determine the first full-length genome nucleotide sequences of four polerovirus isolates from field samples collected in Taiwan.
TW1 was identified as [$Melon aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$MABYV#Virus*]), because it had <10% variation in the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence in any of the encoded proteins when compared to [$MABYV#Virus*]-China.
C-TW20 was most similar to [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) from China with aa sequence identities of >90% for P3 and [$P3#Gene*]-5 and aa identities of 7888% for all the other proteins.
TW19 represents the first full-length sequence for the recently described [$Suakwa aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$SABYV#Virus*]).
The deduced aa sequences for all the proteins of TW19 showed >10% variation compared to all other [@poleroviruses#Virus*], [@though recombination analysis#Method*] suggested [$MABYV#Virus*] as the major parent and an unidentified polerovirus as minor parent.
R-TW82 was identified as a strain of [$CABYV#Virus*], as the deduced [$CP#Gene*] aa sequence showed >90% identity to that of other [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates, and [@recombination analysis#Method*] suggested that [$MABYV#Virus*] was the major parent with [$CABYV#Virus*] the minor parent.
Comparative details of the new full-length sequences and their implications on criteria for distinguishing polerovirus species are discussed.
