This study was conducted to establish an efficient screening system to identify [@melon#Plant*] resistant to [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*].[@F.oyxsporum f.sp.melonis GR#Virus*] was isolated from infected [$melon plants#Plant*] collected at Goryeong and identified as [$F.oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] based on morphological characteristics, molecular analyses, and host-specificity tests on [$cucurbits#Plant*] including [$melon#Plant*], oriental [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*].
In addition, the GR isolate was determined as race 1 based on resistance responses of [$melon#Plant*] differentials to the [$fungus#Virus*].
To select optimized medium for mass production of inoculum of [$F.oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] GR, six media were tested.
The [$fungus#Virus*] produced the most spores (microconidia) in V8-juice broth.
Resistance degrees to the GR isolate of 22 commercial [$melon cultivars#Plant*] and 6 rootstocks for [$melon plants#Plant*] were investigated.
All tested [$rootstocks#Plant*] showed no symptoms of [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] Among the tested [$melon cultivars#Plant*], only three cultivars were susceptible and the other cultivars displayed moderate to high resistance to the GR isolate.
For further study, six [$melon cultivars#Plant*] (Redqueen, Summercool, Superseji, Asiapapaya, Eolukpapaya, and Asiahwanggeum) showing different degrees of resistance to the [$fungus#Virus*] were selected.
The development of [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] on the cultivars was tested according to several conditions such as plant growth stage, root wounding, dipping period of roots in spore suspension, inoculum concentration, and incubation temperature to develop the disease.
On the basis of the test results, we suggest that an efficient screening method for [$melon plants#Plant*] resistant to [$F.oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] is to remove soil from roots of seven-day-old [$melon seedlings#Plant*], to dip the [$seedlings#Plant*] without cutting.
in spore suspension of 3 x 10(5) [$conidia#Virus*]/mL for 30 min, to transplant the inoculated [$seedlings#Plant*] to plastic pots with horticulture nursery media, and then to cultivate the plants in a growth room at 25 to 28 degrees C for about 3 weeks with 12-hour light per day.
