[@Virus diseases#Disease*] are the major cause of economic losses in commercial [$cucurbit#Plant*] production in Lebanon.
This survey revealed that [@Zucchini yellow mosaic Potyvirus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) and [@Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows Polerovirus#Virus*] ([@CABYV#Virus*]) are the most common viruses of field-grown [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Lebanon.
They are followed by [@Watermelon mosaic Potyvirus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [@Papaya ringspot Potyvirus-watermelon strain#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) and to a [@lesser extent Cucumber mosaic Cucumovirus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]).
Cross-protection with a mild strain of [$ZYMV-WK#Plant*] gave significant protection of [$squash #Plant*]plants against severe virus symptoms and resulted in significant yield increase as compared to the control.
Silver plastic mulch also gave a significant protection against viral diseases and a higher total yield than controls.
However, the best protection and highest total yield were obtained with floating row covers.
The integration of cross-protection with silver mulch or with floating row covers improved the protection obtained with either approach.
