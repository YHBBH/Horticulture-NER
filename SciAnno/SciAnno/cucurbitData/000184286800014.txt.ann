[@Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) are [$potyviruses#Virus*] frequently reported in [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Mediterranean, subtropical, and tropical regions.
Occasionally, epidemics are also observed in more temperate regions, but the ways these viruses are introduced into new areas are not yet fully determined.
We investigated the possibility that infected imported [$melon#Plant*] fruit could be a route for the introduction of [$PRSV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*].
Imported [$melon#Plant*] fruits of the yellow canary type infected by [$ZYMV#Virus*] and [$PRSV#Virus*] were exposed in the fields next to healthy [$melon#Plant*] or [$squash #Plant*]bait plants.
During this period, [@aphids#Virus*] were observed landing and probing on the fruits.
In four independent experiments using different fruits, 3.1 to 25% of bait plants were infected by [$ZYMV#Virus*] and/or [$PRSV#Virus*].
[$PRSV#Virus*] was more frequently transmitted to bait plants than [$ZYMV#Virus*].
Comparison of partial sequences of the isolates from fruits and from bait plants showed a very high, if not complete, identity within each experiment, confirming that a natural transmission did occur from the fruit to the bait plants.
These results suggest that globalization of [$melon#Plant*] production and international trade may be a factor in the spread of [$cucurbit potyviruses#Virus*] between countries or continents.
