Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), the first enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway, plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and adaptation.
PAL enzymes are encoded by a gene family in plants.
Here, we report a genome-wide search for [@PAL genes#Gene*] in [$watermelon#Plant*].
A total of 12 [$PAL genes#Gene*], designated [@ClPAL1-12#Gene*], are identified .
Nine are arranged in tandem in two duplication blocks located on chromosomes 4 and 7, and the other three [@ClPAL genes#Gene*] are distributed as single copies on chromosomes 2, 3, and 8.
Both the cDNA and protein sequences of [@ClPALs#Gene*] share an overall high identity with each other.
A [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] places 11 of the [$ClPALs#Gene*] into a separate [$cucurbit #Plant*]subclade, whereas [@ClPAL2#Gene*], which belongs to neither monocots nor dicots, may serve as an ancestral PAL in plants.
In the [$cucurbit #Plant*]subclade, seven [$ClPALs#Gene*] form homologous pairs with their counterparts from [$cucumber#Plant*].
Expression profiling reveals that 11 of the [$ClPAL genes#Gene*] are expressed and show preferential expression in the stems and male and female flowers.
Six of the 12 [$ClPALs#Gene*] are moderately or strongly expressed in the fruits, particularly in the pulp, suggesting the potential roles of PAL in the development of fruit color and flavor.
A promoter motif analysis of the [$ClPAL genes#Gene*] implies redundant but distinctive cis-regulatory structures for stress responsiveness.
Finally, duplication events during the evolution and expansion of the [@ClPAL gene#Gene*] family are discussed, and the relationships between the [$ClPAL genes#Gene*] and their [$cucumber#Plant*] orthologs are estimated.
