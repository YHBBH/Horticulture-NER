The [@Monosporascus Cannonballus#Virus*] is the main agent of [$decline#Disease*] roots.
However, grafting is being tested to overcome this disease.
From this perspective, the current research, aimed to screen resistant rootstocks and evaluate the compatibility of grafting [$watermelon#Plant*] [$Crimson Sweet#Plant*].
The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse and Laboratory of Plant Pathology-II, UFERSA Mossoro, RN.
In the first, 12 genotypes were used: [$watermelon#Plant*] (TPR-02978 e TPR-04329); [$melon#Plant*] (TPR-05851 e TPR-08689) e [$pumpkin#Plant*] (TPR-06827, PES-07, PEC-01, PEM-06, PED-02, PEK-05, [$Shintoza#Plant*] e Fito), sown in pots with soil naturally infected by [$M.cannonballus#Virus*].
After 60 days, the roots were evaluated (DR) and (IGD) and (IA).
In the second, [$Crimson Sweet#Plant*] was used as graft and PEC-01, PES-07, PEK-05 and [$Shintoza#Plant*] as rootstocks.
The seventeenth day, were evaluated (% PEG), (AB(2)), (AC), (L), (NF), (DC), (AP), (MSPA) e (MSR).
The experimental design was randomized, using the Scott-Knott and Tukey tests SAEG (R) 9.1.
There were lower notes the (DR): TPR-02978, TPR-06827, TPR-08689, PES-07, PEC-01, PED-02, PEK-05 e [$Shintoza#Plant*].
The (IGD): TPR-02978, TPR-08689, TPR-06827, PES-07, PEC-01, PEM-06, PED-02, PEK-05, [$Shintoza#Plant*] e Fito.
And (IA): PES-07, PEC-01 and PEK-05.
The PEC-01 had the highest (% PEG).
And the highest rates of MSPA and the MSR were obtained in PEC-01 and [$Shintoza#Plant*].
The TPR-02978, TPR-04329, TPR-05851, TPR-08689, TPR-06827, PEM-06, PED-02, [$Shintoza#Plant*] and Fito showed susceptibility.
As for PEK-05, PES-07 and PEC-01, they were resistant to [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] and the latter presented to the graft compatibility [$Crimson Sweet#Plant*].
