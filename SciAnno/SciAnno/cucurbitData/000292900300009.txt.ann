Using irrigation water with a salinity level of 0.8, 2, and 5 g L(-1), the impact of saline water irrigation on the yield and quality of 2 [@Chinese Cucurbit species#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo cv.Huanghe#Plant*]) and [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus.convar megulaspemus#Plant*]) were studied in Minqin Oasis, northwestern China.
Our results show that [$melon#Plant*] yields decreased as water salinity increased, just as concentrations of glutamic acid content [$rose#Plant*], although the concentration of most amino acids did not differ significantly.
In contrast, [$watermelon#Plant*] yields decreased significantly as water salinity [$rose#Plant*], and fruit number, fruit firmness, fruit crude protein, and essential amino acid (EAA) levels of the [$watermelon#Plant*] showed a significant increase as water salinity [$rose#Plant*].
Salt stress on both [$Cucurbit species#Plant*] resulted in an increase in total soluble solids (TSS) and Na(+) concentrations, while Ca(+) and Cl(-) concentrations were not affected significantly.
In conclusion, our results showed that, although [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] yields were restrained by saline water irrigation, fruit quality was not influenced, such as for the fruit's amino acids.
The fact that saline water irrigation is feasible for [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] species shows that saline water is a potential irrigation water resource in arid areas of northwest China.
