[@Cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], caused by the oomycete [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], is a devastating, worldwide-distributed disease of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in the open field and under cover.
This review provides recent data on the taxonomy, biology, ecology, host range, geographic distribution and epidemiology of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
Special attention is given to host-[$pathogen#Virus*] interactions between [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and its economically-important [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], [$C.melo#Plant*], [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*], and [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]); pathogenic variability in [$P.cubensis #Virus*]at the species, genus, and population levels; and, differentiation of pathotypes and races.
Genetics and variability of host resistance and cellular and molecular aspects of such resistance are considered.
A focus is given to methods of [$crop#Plant*] protection, including prevention and agrotechnical aspects, breeding for resistance-classical and transgenic approaches, chemical control and fungicide resistance.
Novel technologies in biological and integrated control are also discussed.
This review also summarizes the most important topics for future research and international collaboration.
