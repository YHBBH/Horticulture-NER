A nonpathogenic mutant strain (path-1) of [$Colletotrichum magna#Virus*] ([$teleomorph#Virus*] [$Glomerella magna#Virus*]) was isolated and grew endophytically in [$cucurbit #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*].
Decay development on the pericarp of [$avocado#Plant*] fruits was significantly delayed in the wild-type (wt) isolate of [$C.magna#Virus*] compared with [$C.gloeosporioides#Virus*] isolate Cg-14, but both isolates colonized mesocarp tissue equally well.
However, path-1 did not cause disease symptoms in either the pericarp or the mesocarp, Electrofocusing of culture filtrates of [$Colletotrichum#Virus*] strains revealed the presence of [$pectate lyase#Gene*] ([$PL#Gene*]) and polygalacturonase (PG) at pIs of 7.9 and 4.8, respectively, but no significant activity from path-1 was detected.
[$Western blot#Method*]s detected [$PL#Gene*] in [$avocado#Plant*] fruit tissue infected with Cg-14 and wild-type [$C.magna#Virus*].
DNA of the three [$Colletotrichum#Virus*] isolates hybridized to a pel probe from C.gloeosoporioides indicating that at the DNA level no deletion in the pel gene was evident in path-1.
Similar levels of pel mRNA expression were also found for wild-type and path-1 of [$C.magna#Virus*], and Cg-14 of [$C.gloeosporioides#Virus*].
However, when [$PL#Gene*] antibodies were crossreacted with cell lysate of [$Colletotrichum#Virus*] strains, [$PL#Gene*] accumulated in the hyphae of path-1 of [$C.magna#Virus*], but was not detected in Cg-14 cell lysate.
This suggests that the malfunction in extracellular secretion of [$PL#Gene*] proteins results in differential [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of path-1 isolate on [$avocado#Plant*].
