[@Bacterial spot#Disease*], caused by [@Xanthomonas cucurbitae#Virus*], was economically an insignificant disease in the United States until 2005.
But, in recent years, the disease occurred widely in [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields in the Midwest.
[@X.cucurbitae#Virus*] caused leaf spot and fruit infection.
Leaf infection was observed from the time of spreading vines until harvest, and infection of fruit occurred from when fruit weights were 0.25 kg until harvest.
[$Field surveys#Method*] were conducted during 2009-2011 to determine incidence of bacterial spot in commercial [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields in the Midwest.
In 2009, bacterial spot was observed in all 17 [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields visited in Illinois.
In 2010, a survey in Illinois showed that bacterial spot occurred in 40 of 50 commercial [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields with symptoms on 3 to 94% of fruit in a field (average 34%).
In 2011, a survey in the Midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin) showed fruit with bacterial spot symptoms in 95 of 111 [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields, with lesions on 3 to 98% of the fruit in a field (average 79%).
[$X.cucurbitae#Virus*] was isolated from infected leaves and fruit.
The identity of the [$pathogen#Virus*] was confirmed by culturing on yeast extract-dextrose-CaCO3 agar, conducting biochemical and physiological tests, and using primers RST2 and RST3.
Koch's postulates for representative isolates were carried out on leaves of the [$pumpkin#Plant*] cv.
'Howden' in a greenhouse.
Koch's postulates for five of the isolates were also conducted in a field.
To determine a host-range of [$X.cucurbitae#Virus*], five isolates of the [$pathogen#Virus*] were mixed and inoculated onto leaves of 38 plant species in eight families ([$Cucurbitaceae#Virus*], [@Brassicaceae#Plant*], [$Chenopodiaceae#Plant*], [@Graminae#Plant*], [@Leguminosae#Plant*], [@Liliaceae#Plant*], [$Solanaceae#Plant*], [@Umbelliferae#Plant*]) that are commonly grown in [$crop#Plant*] rotation with [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Only plant species in the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] developed typical symptoms of bacterial spot.
