Soil sickness is often observed in [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] such as [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*], but not in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] such as [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*],  and [@Luffa cylindrica#Plant*].
Results showed that root aqueous extracts of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] were autotoxic, but those of [$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*], [@Momordica charantia#Plant*] and [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*] were less autotoxic to the radicle elongation of respective species.
Plant growth of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] were greatly inhibited by autotoxic substances released from powered root tissue at a rate of 1 g per seedling.
Root exudates of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] were autotoxic to radicle elongation and seedling growth of respective species.
However, root exudates of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] did not inhibit radicle elongation of [@Cucurbita ficifolia#Plant*], which is commonly used as rootstock for the grafting of [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] and [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] to decrease [$soil-borne diseases#Disease*] in commercial production.
It seems possible to overcome autotoxicity in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] by grafting on [$Cucurbita ficifolia#Plant*].
