[@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*], a [$cucurbit species#Plant*] responsive to inductive short-day (SD) photoperiods, and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) were used to test whether long-distance movement of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) mRNA or FT is required for floral induction.
Ectopic expression of FT by [$ZYMV#Virus*] was highly effective in mediating floral induction of long-day (LD)-treated plants.
Moreover, the infection zone of [$ZYMV#Virus*] was far removed from floral meristems, suggesting that FT transcripts do not function as the florigenic signal in this system.
Heterografting demonstrated efficient transmission of a florigenic signal from flowering [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] stocks to LD-grown [@C.moschata scions#Plant*].
[@Real-time RT-PCR#Method*] performed on phloem sap collected from [$C.maxima#Plant*] stocks detected no FT transcripts, whereas mass spectrometry of phloem sap proteins revealed the presence of Cm-FTL1 and Cm-FTL2.
Importantly, studies on LD- and SD-treated [$C.moschata#Plant*] plants established that Cmo-FTL1 and Cmo-FTL2 are regulated by photoperiod at the level of movement into the phloem and not by transcription.
Finally, mass spectrometry of florally induced heterografted [$C.moschata scions#Plant*] revealed that [$C.maxima#Plant*] FT, but not FT mRNA, crossed the graft union in the phloem translocation stream.
Collectively, these studies are consistent with FT functioning as a component of the florigenic signaling system in the [$cucurbits#Plant*].
