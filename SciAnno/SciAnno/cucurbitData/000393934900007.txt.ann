During the past two decades, a resurgence of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] has occurred around the world, resulting in severe disease epidemics.
In the United States, resurgence of the disease occurred in 2004 and several hypotheses, including introduction of a new genetic recombinant or pathotype of the [$pathogen#Virus*], have been suggested as potential causes for this resurgence.
Occurrence and distribution of mating types of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] in the United States were investigated using 40 isolates collected from [$cucurbits#Plant*] across 11 states from 2005 to 2013.
Pairing of unknown isolates with known mating-type tester strains on detached leaves of [$cantaloupe#Plant*] or [$cucumber#Plant*] resulted in oospore formation 8 to 10 days after inoculation.
Isolates differed in their ability to form oospores across all coinoculation pairings, with oospore numbers ranging from 280 to 1,000 oospores/c(m)2 of leaf tissue.
Oospores were hyaline to golden-yellow, spherical, and approximately 36 gm in diameter.
Of the 40 isolates tested, 24 were found to be of the A1 mating type, while 16 were of the A2 mating type.
Mating type was significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with host type, whereby all isolates collected from [$cucumber#Plant*] were of the Al mating type, while isolates from [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*] were of the A2 mating type Similarly, mating type was significantly (P = 0.0287) associated with geographical region, where isolates from northern-tier states of Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio were all Al, while isolates belonging to either Al or A2 mating type were present in equal proportions in southern-tier states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas.
Viability assays showed that oospores were viable and, on average, approximately 40% of the oospores produced were viable as determined by the plasmolysis method.
This study showed that Al and A2 mating types of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]are present and the [$pathogen#Virus*] could potentially reproduce sexually in [$cucurbits#Plant*] within the United States.
In addition, the production of viable oospores reported in this study suggests that oospores could have an important role in the biology of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and could potentially influence the epidemiology of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] in the United States.
