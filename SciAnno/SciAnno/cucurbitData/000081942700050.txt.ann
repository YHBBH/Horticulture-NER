[@Downy mildew#Disease*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([@Pseudoperonospora cubensis/Berk.#Virus*]and Curt./Rostov.) has been a serious problem in Central Europe since 1984.
The present paper is a critical survey of most important results relating to the host-pathogen interaction ([$Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] - P.
cubensis) from the viewpoint of host ([@Cucumis spp.#Plant*], [$Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]) and pathogen variability and resistance breeding.
Geographical distribution of [@P.cubensis#Virus*] is analysed and new data on the spread of this parasite in Europe are discussed.
There are more than 50 [$cucurbit#Plant*]aceaous species known as hosts of [@P.cubensis#Virus*].
Until now, there has been limited knowledge on intraspecific variation and genetics in a host-pathogen system.
New data related to the physiological specialization of [@P.cubensis #Virus*]are given.
Recent experimental data suggest that all [@Cucumis sativus L.cvs.#Plant*]released in breeding programs around the world are highly susceptible to the Czech isolates of this fungus.
Similar results were obtained in a study of the germplasm collection of [@C.sativus#Plant*].
Also, among available wild [$Cucumis#Plant*] species no valuable sources of resistance were detected.
Only [$Cucumis melo#Plant*], line MR-1 and some other PI accessions are resistant or incompletely resistant.
In [@C, sativus#Plant*] cultivars and accessions, there is a relatively large variation in the level of field resistance to [@P.cubensis#Virus*].
Some accessions (e.g.
PI 197085, PI 197088, PI 288238) and cultivars (e.g.
Dalnevostobnyj-6, Poinsett 76) express a high level of field resistance.
[@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]
are characterized by a high level of resistance under laboratory and field conditions.
[$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] acces[$sions#Plant*] and cultivars showed high variation in reaction to [@P.cubensis#Virus*] after artificial inoculation in the laboratory.
This phenomenon is closely related to fruit shape (morphotype).
In [@C.pepo#Plant*], there is a negative correlation between resistance to [@P.cubensis#Virus*] and to [$powdery mildew#Disease*].
