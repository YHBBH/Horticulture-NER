Cucurbit crops are cultivated throughout the world.
Melon (Cucumis melo L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Mat.
et Nak.), squash and pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) are the major crops.
In Latin America and the Caribbean islands (LAC) cucurbits are consumed as a part of the daily diet since pre-Columbian times, when some species such as Cucurbita pepo L., Cucurbita moschata Duch.
and Cucurbita maxima Duch.
were domesticated by American Indians.
In LAC, cucurbit crops have become export commodities and a source of income for several countries, in addition to their role in local consumption.
The increase of area devoted to cucurbit crops and the intensification of production has led to the emergence of severe viral epidemics that threaten the sustainability of these cultures.
This paper reviews the cucurbit viruses described in the region and their impact.
In addition, the potential of different measures to control the most frequent cucurbit viruses in LAC is discussed.
