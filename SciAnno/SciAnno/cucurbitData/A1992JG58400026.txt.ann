Continuous monitoring of steady-state carbon dioxide exchange rates in mature [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) leaves showed diurnal patterns of photosynthesis and respiration that were translated into distinct patterns of accumulation and phloem export of soluble sugars and amino acids.
Leaf soluble sugar patterns in general followed the pattern of photosynthetic activity observed in the leaf, whereas starch accumulated steadily throughout the light period.
Sugar and starch levels declined through the dark phase.
Phloem exudate analysis revealed that diurnal levels of the major transport sugars (stachyose and sucrose) in the phloem did not appear to correlate directly with the photosynthetic activity of the leaf but instead were inversely correlated with leaf starch accumulation and degradation.
The amino acid pool in leaf tissues remained constant throughout the diurnal period; however, the relative contribution of individual amino acids to the total pool varied with the diurnal photosynthetic and respiratory activity of the leaf.
In contrast, the phloem sap amino acid pool size was substantially larger in the light than in the dark, a result primarily due to enhanced export of glutamine, glutamate, and citrulline during the light period.
The results indicate that the sugar and amino acid composition of [$cucurbit #Plant*]phloem sap is not constant but varies throughout the diurnal cycle in response to the metabolic activities of the source leaf.
