[@Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]) is the cause of viral [$watermelon vine decline#Method*].
The virus is [$whitefly#Virus*]-transmitted, induces a systemic wilt of [$watermelon#Plant*] plants, and causes necrosis and discoloration of the fruit rind.
In the field, [$SqVYV#Virus*] is often detected in [$watermelon#Plant*] in mixed infections with other viruses including the [$aphid#Virus*]-transmitted [$Papaya ringspot virus type W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]).
In this study, [$watermelon#Plant*] plants of different ages were inoculated with [$SqVYV#Virus*] or [$SqVYV#Virus*]+[$PRSV-W#Virus*] in the greenhouse or [$SqVYV#Virus*] in the field to characterize the physiological response to infection.
Symptoms of [$vine decline#Disease*] appeared about 12 to 16 days after inoculation with [$SqVYV#Virus*] regardless of plant age at time of inoculation, plant growth habit (trellised or nontrellised), and location (greenhouse or field).
However, the presence of [$PRSV-W#Virus*] delayed the appearance of [$vine decline#Disease*] symptoms by 2 to 4 days, and [$vine decline#Disease*] did not develop on plants with no fruit.
For all inoculation treatments, more severe symptoms were observed in younger [$watermelon#Plant*] plants.
Physiological responses to [$SqVYV#Virus*] infection included reduction in plant and fruit weights, alterations in fruit rind and flesh color, reduction in fruit sucrose content, increase in fruit acid content, and changes in plant nutrient composition, particularly increases in Ca, Mg, B, Mn, and Zn and decreases in K and N.
These results demonstrate wide-ranging physiological effects of [$SqVYV#Virus*] infection and provide new insights into [$watermelon vine decline#Method*].
