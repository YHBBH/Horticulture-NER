[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) is an emerging virus causing significant yield losses in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Simple but reliable detection and quantification methods are important tools for disease management.
In susceptible germplasm, [$CYSDV#Virus*] was detected 5 days postinoculation (dpi) by reverse transcriptase [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) or by [$tissue blot immunoassay#Method*] ([$TBIA#Method*]), and 8-9 dpi by [$dot blot immunoassay#Method*] ([$DBIA#Method*]) or [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]).
For [$CYSDV#Virus*] quantification, real-time [$RT-PCR#Method*] was the most sensitive method and gave the best linear range of detection, over four orders of magnitude as compared to approximately two orders of magnitude for [$DBIA#Method*] and nucleic acid hybridization.
[$DBIA#Method*] was more sensitive than [$ELISA#Method*] and equally sensitive to nucleic acid hybridization with a non-radioactively labelled cDNA probe.
Time course studies at 3, 5, 8 and 14 dpi using [$TBIA#Method*] revealed that tolerance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] in three tolerant [$cucumber#Plant*] germplasms was not correlated with restricted or delayed virus movement.
