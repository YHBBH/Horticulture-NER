Pepper (Capsicum annuum) is an important crop worldwide.
In Israel, approximately 2,500 ha are grown all year round for the local and export markets.
Herein, we report the identification of a viral pathogen causing a new devastating disease in pepper crops.
The disease syndrome includes shortening of stem internodes, interveinal yellowing, and upward rolling of the leaf blade, accompanied by fruit discoloration and size reduction.
Virus purification from infected plants yielded isometric particles, 25 nm in diameter.
The causal agent of the disease was tentatively named Pepper yellow leaf curl virus (PYLCV).
The virus cross-reacted in DAS ELISA with antisera against Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus and Potato leafroll virus, members of the Polerovirus genus.
The partial nucleotide sequence obtained from the cloned viral coat protein and movement protein genes indicated 92% identity at the amino acid level with Tobacco vein distortion virus (TVDV), another member of the Polerovirus genus.
However, the host range of PYLCV is significantly different from the host range described for TVDV.
Based on our findings, the taxonomic status of PYLCV is discussed.
