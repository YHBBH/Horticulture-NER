BACKGROUNDThe [@squash bug#Virus*], [$Anasa tristis#Virus*] (De Geer), is a major insect pest of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Control of [$squash bugs#Virus*] with insecticidal chemicals is difficult to achieve.
We investigated the potential of companion planting with white yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.) or feverfew [Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Sch.
Bip.] for [$squash bug#Virus*] management in field plantings of[$ summer squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]).
   RESULTSCompanion planting with white yarrow had few effects.
Companion planting with feverfew tended to reduce [$squash bug#Virus*] populations, but results often were not statistically significant (P 0.05).
Early-season ventilated row covers (without herbs) neither reduced [$squash bug#Virus*] populations nor increased [$squash #Plant*]yields.
Herbs reduced marketable [$squash #Plant*]yields compared with the control only once out of seven experiments.
   CONCLUSIONThe tested companion planting strategies inconsistently affected [$squash bug#Virus*] populations on[$ summer squash#Plant*].
Therefore, these strategies are not recommended to commercial producers.
