The responses of a diverse group of vining cucurbits to inoculation with [@Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]) were determined.
For the first time, [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*], [$Cucumis dipsaceus#Plant*], and [$Cucumis metuliferus#Plant*] were observed to develop necrosis and plant death similar to the [$SqVYV#Virus*]-induced [$vine decline#Disease*] in [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]).
The majority of [$cucurbits#Plant*] inoculated, however, either exhibited no symptoms of infection, or developed relatively mild symptoms such as vein yellowing of upper, noninoculated leaves.
All inoculated plants were sectioned and tested for the presence of [$SqVYV#Virus*].
The virus was widely distributed in mature, fruit-bearing [$cucurbits#Plant*] with over 72% of plant sections testing positive for [$SqVYV#Virus*] by [@tissue-blot and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*].
Plants of several [$cucurbits#Plant*], including a wild citron ([$Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*]), were symptomless and had a decreased frequency of virus infection of [$vine#Plant*] segments compared to susceptible vining [$cucurbits#Plant*], indicating a higher level of resistance.
However, no significant relationship between the frequency of infection or virus distribution within plants and the symptom response was observed.
These results demonstrate that a diverse group of [$cucurbits#Plant*] may decline when infected with [$SqVYV#Virus*], and suggest that widespread distribution of virus within the plant is not the sole cause of decline.
