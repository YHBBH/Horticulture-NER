The [@melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae#Virus*] ([@Coquillett#Virus*]) is one of the world's most serious pests of [$vegetable crops#Plant*], particularly plants in the family [$Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
It commonly infests immature fruits and flowers: stems and roots of [$host plants#Plant*] can also be attacked.
It is remarkable for rapid development of larvae, and the long life-span and dispersal ability of adults.
Following dispersal to new areas, adults reside in areas where [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] are cultivated, or in areas of short vegetation where wild [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts are common.
[@Melon fly#Virus*] was first detected in the Solomon Islands in 1984.
Spreading from Western Province, it is now found in six of the country's nine provinces.
[$Melon fly#Virus*] was first detected on Guadalcanal in November 1995 in the Honiara area.
A field study in this area revealed that catches of [@melon fly#Virus*] in Cue-lure traps were low but stable.
The fruit of a wild [$cucurbit#Plant*] vine was the most important [$melon fly#Virus*] host in the town area.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] was the only other host recorded.
No [@melon flies#Virus*] were reared from [$tomato#Plant*] or [@papaya#Plant*].
There is a plan to introduce a parasitoid, Psyttalia fletcheri (Silvestri), from Hawaii to reduce populations of this pest.
