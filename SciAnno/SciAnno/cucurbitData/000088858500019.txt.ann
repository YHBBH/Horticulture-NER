At least three sources of resistance to the [@watermelon#Plant*] strain of [@Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) have been identified in [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) including: 'TMG-1', an inbred line derived from the Taiwanese cultivar,'Taichung Mou Gua';'Dina-1', an inbred line derived from the Dutch hybrid 'Dina'; and the South American cultivar 'Surinam'.
In this investigation we sought to determine the inheritance of resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] in 'Dina-1', the allelic relationships among the three sources of [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resistance, and the relationship between [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resistance and known resistances to other [@cucurbit potyviruses#Virus*].
Like 'Surinam' and 'TMG-1', resistance in 'Dina-1' is controlled by a single gene.
Despite differences in dominance vs recessive performance and patterns of virus accumulation, all three sources of resistance complemented each other.
'TMG-1' and 'Dina-1' also possess co-segregating, single-gene resistances to [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [@Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] and [@Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*].
Sequential inoculations and F-3 family analysis indicated that resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] completely cosegregated with resistance to [$ZYMV#Virus*] in 'TMG-1'.
Although [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resistances are at the same locus in both 'TMG-1' and 'Surinam','Surinam' is only resistant to [$PRSV-W#Virus*], and progeny of 'TMG-1' x 'Surinam' were resistant to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] but susceptible to [$ZYMV#Virus*].
Susceptibility to [$ZYMV#Virus*] and resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] in 'Surinam' was not influenced by co-inoculation or sequential inoculations of the two viruses.
Collectively, the cosegregation of resistances to [$PRSV-W#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*], [@WMV#Virus*] and [@MWMV#Virus*] in 'TMG-1' (within I cM), allelism of [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resistances in 'TMG-1' and 'Surinam', and resistance to only [$PRSV-W#Virus*] in 'Surinam', suggest that multiple potyvirus resistance in [$cucumber#Plant*] may be due to different alleles of a single potyvirus resistance gene with differing viral specificities, or that the multiple resistances are conferred by a tightly linked cluster of resistance genes, of which 'Surinam' only possesses one member.
