Grafting is a unique horticultural technology that allows the grower to select an alternate, compatible root system with natural disease resistance for their desired crop.
Short-term storage of grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] under low temperature may extend the production window of grafted [$seedlings#Plant*], reduce the labor input and increase production of grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] with a small propagation capacity.
To evaluate the low temperature storage conditions, [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] 'Olympic Gold' [$seedlings#Plant*] were grafted onto[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima x[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata 'Tetsukabuto' rootstock and stored for a period of 2 or 4 weeks at 9, 12, or 15 degrees C under 12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux (PPF).
The study demonstrated that grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] could be stored at 12 degrees C for 4 weeks without significant dry mass accumulation or effects on post-storage growth and development.
Grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] stored at 15 degrees C for 4 weeks had a significant increase in dry mass and stem elongation; this was not observed for the non-grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] stored under the same conditions, suggesting that the rootstock enhanced the scion growth at lower temperatures than optimal for [$muskmelon#Plant*].
Storing [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] at 9 degrees C caused [$chilli#Plant*]ng damage but the damage was pronounced for non-grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] than grafted [$seedlings#Plant*].
'Tetsukabuto' rootstock, an interspecific [$squash#Plant*], presumably has a [$chilli#Plant*]ng tolerance and increased the storability of [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*].
Further optimization is needed but there is potential for using this technique as a tool for mass production of grafted [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*].
