[@Cucurbits#Plant*] are often cultivated in rotation with [$Solanaceae #Plant*]in double-cropping systems.
Most [$cucurbits#Plant*] have been described as susceptible to [@root-knot nematodes#Disease*] (RKN) but little is known on their relative levels of susceptibility.
Because RKN species differ in rates of root invasion and reproductive traits, isolates of [@M.arenaria#Virus*], [@M.incognita#Virus*] and [@M.javanica#Virus*] were compared on five [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts in experiments run in a climate growth chamber.
They included [@zucchini squash cv Amalthee#Plant*], [@cucumber cv Dasher II#Plant*], [@melon cv Pistolero#Plant*], [@pumpkin cv Totanera#Plant*] and [@watermelon cv Sugar Baby#Plant*].
All [$cucurbits#Plant*] were susceptible to the three RKN isolates although [$M.javanica#Virus*] showed higher invasion rates, faster development and higher egg production than [$M.arenaria#Virus*] on the selected [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Apparent differences among [$cucurbits#Plant*] were primarily due to root invasion rates and formation of egg masses.
Both [$Cucumis#Plant*] species ([$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*]) were better hosts for nematode invasion and reproduction than [$zucchini squash#Plant*], followed by [$watermelon#Plant*].
Large invasion rates followed by small reproduction traits were linked to [$M.incognita#Virus*] on [$zucchini squash#Plant*].
Reduced invasion rates and egg mass formation along with delayed early development were shown on [$watermelon#Plant*].
