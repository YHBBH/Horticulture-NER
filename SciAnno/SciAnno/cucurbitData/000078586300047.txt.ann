A nonpathogenic mutant of Colletotrichum magna (path-1) was previously shown to protect [@watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) [$seedlings#Plant*] from [$anthracnose#Disease*] disease elicited by wild-type C.
magna.
Disease protection was observed in stems of path-1-colonized [$cucurbits#Plant*] but not in cotyledons, indicating that path-1 conferred tissue-specific and/or localized protection.
Plant biochemical indicators of a localized and systemic (peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, lignin, and salicylic acid) "plant-defense" response were investigated in [@anthracnose#Virus*]-resistant and -susceptible cultivars of [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] exposed to four treatments: (1) water (control), (2) path-1 conidia, (3) wild-type conidia, and (4) challenge conditions (inoculation into path-1 conidia for 48 h and then exposure to wild-type conidia).
Collectively, these analyses indicated that disease protection in path-1-colonized plants was correlated with the ability of these plants to mount a defense response more rapidly and to equal or greater levels than plants exposed to wild-type C.
magna alone.
[@Watermelon#Plant*] plants colonized with path-1 were also protected against disease caused by [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*] and [$Fusarium oxysporum#Virus*].
A model based on the kinetics of plant-defense activation is presented to explain the mechanism of path-1-conferred disease protection.
