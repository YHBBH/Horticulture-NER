The objective of this study was to determine the effects of chitosan to control powdery mildew on [@cucumber#Plant*] cotyledons inoculated with races 1, 2 and 5 of [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*] and race 1 of [$Erysiphe cichoracearum#Virus*].
Chitosan, an elicitor of plant defences and also an inhibitor of fungal growth, was sprayed on the upper surface of cotyledons at concentrations 1% and 2.5%.
Control cotyledons were sprayed with sterile water only.
When cotyledons had dried they were inoculated by applying eight 5 mu l droplets of a [$conidia#Virus*]l suspension (4x10(4) or 4x10(5) spores ml(-1)) on the adaxial surface of each cotyledon.
The number of lesions developed ([$mildew#Virus*] incidence) and lesion size were evaluated ten days after inoculation.
The highest chitosan concentration significantly inhibited the [$mildew#Virus*] incidence on pretreated cotyledons inoculated with races of [@S.fuliginea#Virus*] and race 1 of [$E.cichoracearum#Virus*], at both [$conidia#Virus*]l concentrations compared to control.
Significant differences in lesion diameters were observed between chitosan-treated cotyledons and controls after inoculation with [$S.fuliginea#Virus*] and [$E.cichoracearum#Virus*] when 4x10(5) spores ml(-1) were used.
