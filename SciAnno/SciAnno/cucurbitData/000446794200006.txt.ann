[@Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$ZLCV#Virus*]), genus Ortho[$tospovirus#Virus*], so far was only reported in Brasil.
The main natural hosts of [$ZLCV#Virus*] are in the [$cucurbit family#Plant*].
[$Pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima#Plant*]) cultivar Exposicao was previously reported as highly resistant to [$ZLCV#Virus*] infection.
The objectives of this work were to better characterize the resistance of the Exposicao cultivar to [$ZLCV#Virus*] and to evaluate the interference of [$potyviruses#Virus*] ([@papaya ringspot virus type W#Virus*], [$PRSV-W#Virus*], and [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*]) in the [$ZLCV#Virus*] resistance of this cultivar.
[$C.maxima#Plant*] 'Exposicao' and [$zucchini#Plant*] ([$C.pepo#Plant*]) 'Caserta' (susceptible control) plants were mechanically inoculated with [$ZLCV#Virus*] in the cotyledons.
Resistance to infection and systemic virus movement were evaluated at 7 and 20 days later.
[$Virus#Virus*] detection was performed using [$PTA-ELISA#Method*] and [$RT-PCR#Method*] in the cotyledons and upper leaves.
The interference of the [$potyviruses#Virus*] in [$ZLCV#Virus*] resistance was evaluated in greenhouse and field assays.
[$ZLCV#Virus*] was detected in the inoculated cotyledons of both cultivars, but it did not move systemically in [$C.maxima#Plant*] 'Exposicao'.
The [$potyviruses#Virus*] [$PRSV-W#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] did not interfere in the response of [$C.maxima#Plant*] 'Exposicao' to infection with [$ZLCV#Virus*].
The resistance of 'Exposicao' to [$ZLCV#Virus*] can be explored in future [$cucurbitaceae#Plant*] breeding programs.
