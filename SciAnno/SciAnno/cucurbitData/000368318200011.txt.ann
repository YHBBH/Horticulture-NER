[@Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]; [$genus Crinivirus#Virus*], [$family Closteroviridae#Virus*]) was identified in the [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) production regions of the desert southwestern United States in fall 2006.
It is now well established in the region, where it is transmitted efficiently by the [$sweet potato#Plant*] [$whitefly#Virus*], [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] biotype B (MEAM1).
In order to evaluate the spread and establishment of the virus, nearly all spring and fall [$cucurbit #Plant*]fields planted in the Imperial Valley of California from 2007 to 2009 were surveyed and representative plants were tested for [$CYSDV#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]ction.
Incidence of [$CYSDV#Virus*] in spring [$melon#Plant*] fields was initially low and limited to a small number of fields in 2007 but increased to 63% of fields by spring 2009.
[$Virus#Virus*] incidence in fall [$melon#Plant*] fields was 100% in each year.
These results suggested that the virus had become established in native vegetation, [$weeds#Plant*], and other [$crop#Plant*] species, and represented an increasing threat to [$melon#Plant*] production in the southwestern United States.
Therefore, a select set of [$weed#Plant*] and [$crop#Plant*] species which grow or are cultivated in the Imperial Valley were evaluated as [$CYSDV#Virus*] reservoir hosts.
For each species, we determined the capacity of [$CYSDV#Virus*] to accumulate, the relationship between virus titer in these source plants and transmission by [$whiteflies#Virus*], as well as subsequent accumulation in inoculated [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
Among these hosts, there was considerable variation in virus accumulation and transmission rates.
[$Cucurbit#Plant*] hosts had the highest [$CYSDV#Virus*] titers, were efficient sources for virus acquisition, and showed a positive correlation between titer in source plants and transmission.
Non[$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts had significantly lower [$CYSDV#Virus*] titers and varied in their capacity to serve as sources for transmission.
[$CYSDV#Virus*] titers in some non[$cucurbit #Plant*]source plants, specifically [$common bean#Plant*] ([$Phaseolus vulgaris#Plant*]) and shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), were not positively correlated with transmission, demonstrating that additional environmental, physical, or biochemical factors were involved.
These results demonstrate that multiple factors influence the efficiency with which a host plant species will be a reservoir for vector transmission of virus to [$crops#Plant*].
