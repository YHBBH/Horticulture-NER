[@Watermelon#Plant*] [[@Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.& Nakai#Plant*]] is a major [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] that accounted for 7.5 % of the world area devoted to [$vegetable#Plant*] production in 2003.
[$Potyvirus#Virus*]es are a major limiting factor in commercial [$watermelon#Plant*] production worldwide.
The major viruses affecting [$watermelon#Plant*] are [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*]-[$watermelon#Plant*] strain ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), and [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]).
Sources of resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] have been reported.
These were PI (plant introduction) accessions from South Africa (PI 244017, PI 244018, PI 244019), from Zimbabwe (PI 482342, PI 482318, PI 482379), from Botswana (PI 485583), and from Nigeria (PI 595203).
A single recessive gene controls resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*], with the gene symbol prv.
Resistance to [$WMV#Virus*] is a quantitative trait in [$watermelon#Plant*], with approximately 3 major loci involved.
PI 595203 is resistant to [$ZYMV#Virus*], and is also moderately resistant to [$WMV#Virus*].
The USDA germplasm collection of 1613 PI accessions was screened for resistance to the Florida strain of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]-FL).
A high level of resistance to [$ZYMV#Virus*]-FL was found in several acces[$sions#Plant*]: PI 386019, PI 490377, PI 596662, PI 485580, PI 560016, PI 494528, PI 386016, PI 482276, and PI 595201.
The study also confirmed the resistance of PI 595203, PI 386025, PI 386026, and PI 494528 that was reported previously.
Resistance of PI 595203 was confirmed to the three polyviruses [$PRSV-W#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*], so it will be useful in the development of multiple-virus resistant cultivars.
Inheritance of resistance to [$Zucchini#Plant*] - yellow mosaic virus-China strain ([$ZYMV#Virus*]-CH) and [$ZYMV#Virus*]-FL in PI 595203 was reported to be controlled by a single recessive gene.
Further research is needed to determine whether resistance genes for [$ZYMV#Virus*]-FL in PI 482261 and in PI 595203 are allelic.
