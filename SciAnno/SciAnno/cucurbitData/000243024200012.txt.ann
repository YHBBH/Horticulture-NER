Dieldrin and endrin, a group of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), were used extensively on arable land in Japan from 1958 to 1971.
Because of their extreme persistence in soils, dieldrin and endrin have been detected in [$cucumber#Plant*] fruits produced in some areas at concentrations exceeding the limit set by the Food Sanitation Law.
Thus, we compared the uptake of dieldrin and endrin by 32 plant species of arable [$crops#Plant*] in 17 families and by 34 cultivars of [@Cucurbita sp#Plant*].
grown in contaminated soil to select a candidate cleaning [$crop#Plant*] for phytoremediation and substitute produce [$crops#Plant*].
[$Cucurbits#Plant*] took up more dieldrin and endrin than the other families, and uptake by [$zucchini#Plant*] was the highest.
Apart from the [$cucurbits#Plant*], only [$jute#Plant*] ([@Tiliaceae#Plant*]) took up any dieldrin and endrin, and uptake by the other 15 families was negligible.
Among [@Cucurbita sp.#Plant*], a number of cultivars took up nearly as much dieldrin and endrin as [$zucchini#Plant*], and some took up less than popular rootstock cultivars for graft cultivation of [$cucumber#Plant*].
These results suggest that [$cucurbits#Plant*], especially [$zucchini#Plant*], would make good candidates for phytoremediation, and non-[$cucurbits#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] would make good substitute [$crops#Plant*] in dieldrin-contaminated and endrin-contaminated fields.
Moreover, low-uptake [@Cucurbita sp.#Plant*]
cultivars offer promise for breeding substitute [$rootstocks#Plant*] for grafting [$cucumber#Plant*].
To determine the uptake mechanism of dieldrin and endrin, a sand culture experiment was conducted.
Komatsuna ([$Brassica#Plant*] campestris var.
perviridis), [$soybean#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*], which took up negligible chemicals from soil, took up significant quantities from sand culture mixed with dieldrin and endrin.
Therefore, even non-[$cucurbits#Plant*] accumulate dieldrin and endrin under saturated conditions in the rhizospere.
This result suggests that [$cucurbits#Plant*] are able to desorb or dissolve dieldrin and endrin that are strongly sorbed in soil.
