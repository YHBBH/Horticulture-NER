In 2011 and 2012, several [@cucurbit#Plant*]-growing regions of Iran were surveyed and samples with symptoms similar to those induced by [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) were collected.
The [$pathogen#Virus*] was transmitted to [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] under greenhouse conditions by [$whiteflies#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]).
[$RT-PCR#Method*] [@using designed CCYV-specific primer pair#Method*] ([@CCYV-F/CCYV-R#Method*]) resulted in amplification of the predicted size DNA fragment (870 bp) for the [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene in samples collected from Boushehr, Eyvanakay and Varamin.
Nucleotide sequences of the [$CP#Gene*] of the three Iranian [$CCYV#Virus*] isolates were compared with five [$CCYV#Virus*] isolates obtained from GenBank and analysed.
Phylogenetically, all [$CCYV#Virus*] isolates clustered in two groups; Group I is composed of five non-Iranian isolates from China, Lebanon, Japan, Sudan and Taiwan, and the three Iranian isolates formed Group 2.
Among Iranian isolates, the Eyvanakay isolate clustered in a distinct clade with the Boushehr and Varamin isolates.
A [$phylogenetic tree#Method*] based on amino acid identity of [$CP#Gene*] showed that [$CCYV#Virus*] was closely related to [$Lettuce chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$LCV#Virus*]), [@Bean yellow disorder virus#Virus*] ([@BnYDV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]).
This is the first report of [$CCYV#Virus*] in Iran.
