Surveys were conducted during 2004 to 2006 to identify the viruses infecting [@pumpkin#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]in Illinois.
In 2004, 16 jack-o-lantern [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) samples and one [$squash #Plant*]([$C.pepo#Plant*]) sample were collected from I I counties.
In 2005, 85 jack-o-lantern [$pumpkin#Plant*], 12 processing [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]), 37 [$squash#Plant*], and six [$gourd#Plant*] ([$C.pepo#Plant*]) samples were collected from 54 counties.
In 2006, 85 jack-o-lantern [$pumpkin#Plant*], 16 processing [$pumpkin#Plant*], 51 [$squash#Plant*], and 18 [$gourd#Plant*] samples were collected from 47 counties.
[$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [@Tobacco ringspot viru#Virus*] ([@TRSV#Virus*]), [@Tomato ringspot virus#Virus*] ([@ToRSV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), and unknown [$potyviruses#Virus*] were detected in [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$gourd#Plant*] fields during the [$surveys#Method*], using [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]).
Overall, 86, 11, 75, and 79% of jack-o-lantern [$pumpkin#Plant*], processing [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$gourds#Plant*], respectively, were tested positive for virus infection during the survey.
[$WMV#Virus*] was detected in 47, 46, and 52% of the samples in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively, and was the most prevalent virus throughout the state.
[$SqMV#Virus*] was detected in more counties than any other virus because it was identified in 65 and 88% of the counties surveyed in 2005 and 2006, respectively.
[$SqMV#Virus*] was detected in 6, 41, and 48% of the samples in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.
During the [$surveys#Method*], [$CMV#Virus*] was detected in 6, 4, and 3% of the samples; [$PRSV#Virus*] was detected in 6, 11, and 4% of the samples; and [$ZYMV#Virus*] was detected in 18, 4, and 4% of the samples tested in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.
[$TRSV#Virus*] was detected in 3% of the samples in 2005, for the first time on [$pumpkin#Plant*] in Illinois.
Pathogenicity of the detected viruses was proved for [$CMV#Virus*], [$PRSV#Virus*], [$SqMV#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*] on [$summer squash#Plant*] ('Fortune' and 'Grey [$Zucchini#Plant*]'), jack-o-lantern [$pumpkin#Plant*] ('Howden'), and processing [$pumpkin#Plant*] ('Dickinson').
All of the viruses were present alone and mixed in the samples tested.
Earlier in the growing seasons (July and early August), single-virus infections were detected.
Mixed infections were more common from the second week of August until the end of the growing season in October.
Dual infection of [$WMV#Virus*] and [$SqMV#Virus*] was the most prevalent mixed virus infection detected in Illinois.
Most viruses infecting [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]showed similar symptoms.
The most common symptoms observed in the commercial fields and in the greenhouse studies were light- and dark-green mosaic, veinbanding, veinclearing, puckering, and deformation of leaves of [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$gourds#Plant*].
Severe symptoms included fernleaf and shoestring on leaves and color breaking and deformation of fruit.
