[@Cantaloupe#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo var.cantalupo#Plant*]) has become an economically important [$crop#Plant*] in Thailand and the fruit is popular among consumers.
In June 2016, [$gummy stem blight#Disease*], an important disease of [$cucurbits#Plant*], was found on [$cantaloupe#Plant*] in Phayao Province, Thailand.
The causal [$fungus#Virus*] was isolated from lesions and identified as [$Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum#Virus*] based on morphological characteristics and [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of combined sequences of the internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions of ribosomal DNA, and -tubulin genes.
The isolated fungus caused symptoms of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] on inoculated [$cantaloupe#Plant*], which were similar to the natural symptoms observed in the field.
This is the first report in Thailand of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] disease on [$cantaloupe#Plant*] caused by [$S.cucurbitacearum#Virus*].
