The populations of [@Monosporascuscannonballus ascospores#Virus*] in the soils of 14 [@muskmelon#Plant*] fields throughout [$muskmelon#Plant*] production areas of Comunidad Valenciana (eastern Spain) were quantified from 2002 to 2003.
The fields were surveyed in July, at the end of the cropping season, when plants approached maturity and symptoms of [$vine#Plant*] decline in the canopy appeared as patches of wilted or dead plants.
Ascospores were recovered from all [$muskmelon#Plant*] fields surveyed.
The average soil populations ranged from 1.54 to 6.33 per g of soil and the number of ascospores within a soil sample ranged from 0.50 to 16.20 ascospores/g of soil.
This is the first detailed report on ascospore populations of [@M.cannonballus#Virus*] in [$muskmelon#Plant*] fields from a [$cucurbit#Plant*]-growing area in Spain and the Mediterranean basin.
