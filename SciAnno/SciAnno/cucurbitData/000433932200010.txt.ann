Information about chromosomal characteristics is helpful to geneticists and plant breeders in [$crop#Plant*] improvement programmes.The karyomorphological analysis of six commercially cultivated edible species of [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], namely [$Luffa cylindrica#Plant*], [@L.acutangula#Plant*], [$Trichosanthes anguina#Plant*], [$Benincasa hispida#Plant*], [$Cucumis sativus#Plant*] and [$Momordica charantia#Plant*] were investigated.
The chromosome numbers of these six [$cucurbits#Plant*] are 2n = 26, 26, 22, 24,14, and 22 respectively.
All of the [$cucurbits#Plant*] possessed very small chromosomes of the ranges 1.71-1.25 mu m in [$L.cylindrica#Plant*], 1.84-1.15 mu m in L acutangula, 2.87-1.76 mu m in T anguina, 2.78-1.52 mu m in B.hispida, 2.17-1.26 mu m in [$C.sativus#Plant*] and 1.93-1.15 mu m in [$M.charantia#Plant*].
The karyotypes of [$L.cylindrica#Plant*], [$L.acutangula#Plant*] and T anguina are fully symmetric, consisting of all metacentric chromosomes.
The other three, B.hispida, [$C.sativus#Plant*] and [$M.charantia#Plant*], showed symmetric karyotypes, having both metacentric and sub-metacentric chromosomes.
[$Benincasa hispida#Plant*] possesses two pairs of sub-metacentric chromosomes; [$C.sativus#Plant*] and [$M.charantia#Plant*] have one pair each.
These data add to information about karyo-systematics which helps to study inter-species and inter-generic relationships.
This study may also be helpful to [$cucurbit #Plant*]breeders in their future [$crop#Plant*] improvement programmes.
