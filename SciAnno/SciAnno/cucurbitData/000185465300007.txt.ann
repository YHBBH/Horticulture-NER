The bacterium that causes [@cucurbit yellow vine disease#Disease*] ([$CYVD#Disease*]) has been placed in the species [$Serratia marcescens#Virus*] based on [@16S rDNA and groE sequence analysis#Method*].
However, [@phenotypic comparison#Method*] of the organism with [$S.marcescens#Virus*] strains isolated from a variety of ecological niches showed significant heterogeneity.
In this study, we compared the genomic DNA of [$S.marcescens#Virus*] strains from different niches as well as type strains of other [$Serratia spp#Virus*].
through [@repetitive elements-based polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([@rep-PCR#Method*]) and [@DNA-DNA hybridization#Method*].
With the former, [$CYVD#Disease*] strains showed identical banding patterns despite the fact that they were from different [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts, geographic locations, and years of isolation.
In the [$phylogenetic tree#Method*]s generated from [$rep-PCR#Method*] banding patterns, [$CYVD#Disease*] strains clearly were differentiated from other strains but formed a loosely related group with [$S.marcescens#Virus*] strains from other niches.
The homogeneity of [$CYVD#Disease*] strains was supported further by the DNA relatedness study, in that labeled DNA from the [$cantaloupe#Plant*] isolate, C01-A, showed an average relative binding ratio (RBR) of 99%, and 0.33% divergence to other [$CYVD#Disease*] strains.
Used as a representative strain of [$CYVD#Disease*], the labeled C01-A had a RBR of 76%, and a 4.5% divergence to the [$S.marcescens#Virus*] type strain.
These data confirm the previous placement of [$CYVD#Disease*] strains in [$S.marcescens#Virus*].
Our investigations, including [$rep-PCR#Method*], [$DNA-DNA hybridization#Method*], and previous phenotyping experiments, have demonstrated that [$CYVD#Disease*]-associated strains of [$S.marcescens#Virus*] cluster together in a group significantly different from other strains of the species.
