[@Fusarium wilt#Disease*] caused by [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.melonis#Virus*] ([$FOM#Virus*]) is a devastating disease of [$melon#Plant*] worldwide.
[@Pathogenicity tests#Method*] performed with [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]isolates obtained from Italian [$melon#Plant*]-growing areas allowed to identify thirty-four [$FOM#Virus*] isolates and the presence of all four races.
The aims of this work were to examine genetic relatedness among [$FOM#Virus*] isolates by race determination and to perform [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of identified [$FOM#Virus*] races including also other formae speciales of [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]of [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Results showed that [$FOM#Virus*] race 1,2 was the most numerous with a total of eighteen isolates, while six and nine isolates were identified as race 0 and 1, respectively, and just one isolate was assigned to race 2.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] was performed by [$random amplified polymorphic DNA#Method*] ([$RAPD#Method*]) profiling and by translation elongation factor-1 (TEF-1) sequencing.
The analysis of [$RAPD#Method*] profiles separated [$FOM#Virus*] races into two distinct clades.
Clade 1, which included races 0, 1 and 1,2, was further divided into subclade a' which grouped almost all race 1,2 isolates, and into subclade b' which included race 0 and 1 isolates.
Clade 2 comprised only race 2 isolates.
The [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] based on TEF-1 separated [$FOM#Virus*] from the other formae speciales of [$F.oxysporum#Virus*].
Also with TEF-1 analysis, [$FOM#Virus*] races 0, 1 and 1,2 isolates grouped in one single clade clearly separated from [$FOM#Virus*] race 2 isolates which grouped closer to [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]f.sp.cucumerinum.
[$RAPD#Method*] technique was more effective than TEF-1 in differentiating [$FOM#Virus*] race 1,2 isolates from those belonging to the closely related races 0 and 1.
Both [$phylogenetic analyses#Method*] supported the close relationship between the three different [$FOM#Virus*] races which might imply the derivation from one another and the different origin of [$FOM#Virus*] race 2.
