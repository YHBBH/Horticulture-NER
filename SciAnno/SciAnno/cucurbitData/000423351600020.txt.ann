'Candidatus [@Phytoplasma australasia#Virus*]' causes important damages to the Egyptian [$vegetable#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] production.
A prerequisite for controlling the different diseases it causes to [$eggplant#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*], is to trace its propagation pathways.
To allow the differentiation of 'Ca.
P.
australasia' strains, a multilocus [$sequence analysis#Method*] protocol was developed.
Four conserved phytoplama genes namely tuf, secY, dnaK and dppA, were selected among the CDS of a 'Ca.
P.aurantifolia' genome draft.
The corresponding genes were [$PCR#Method*] amplified from [$tomato#Plant*], [$eggplant#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]collected in 2010 from the governorates Sharkia, Elmynia and Beni sueif, as well as from Catharanthus roseus periwinkles collected in 2013 from Kafrelsheikh governorate.
Sequence comparisons showed no diversity among the Egyptian isolates of 'Ca.
P.australasia' that also constitute a distinct cluster within the 16SrII-D taxonomic subgroup.
This low diversity supports a common epidemiology for the different diseases affecting [$vegetable crops#Plant*] and periwinkle in Egypt and suggests that future investigations on insect vector should focus on polyphagous leafhoppers.
