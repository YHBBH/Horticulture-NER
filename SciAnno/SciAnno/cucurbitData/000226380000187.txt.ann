Acibenzolar-S-methyl was screened for its efficacy against a range of diseases in Australian crops.
Crop phytotoxicity was also assessed.
Trial results in [@tomatoes#Plant*], [$lettuce#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], [$ornamentals#Plant*] and various other [$crops#Plant*] indicated that acibenzolar-S-methyl has potential as an alternative [$crop#Plant*] protection tool.
In [$tomatoes#Plant*], acibenzolar-S-methyl applied at 50 g a.i/ha was significantly more effective than copper hydroxide for management of [@Xanthomonas campestris pv.vesicatoria#Virus*] (bacterial spot).
In [$watermelon#Plant*], acibenzolar-S-methyl was as effective as the conventional copper treatment for control of the [@bacterium Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] (bacterial blotch).
   There was a tendency for increased disease control when lower rates of acibenzolar-S-methyl were used in combination with conventional chemicals.
Higher rates alone often resulted in disease control equivalent to the lower rates used in conjunction with conventional chemistry.
However, in a number of trials, the higher rates of acibenzolar-S-methyl resulted in [$crop#Plant*] phytotoxicity.
