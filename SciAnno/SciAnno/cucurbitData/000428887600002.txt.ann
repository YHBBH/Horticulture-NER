[@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] ([$pumpkin#Plant*]) is a typical [$cucurbit #Plant*]that is susceptible to [$gummy stem blight#Disease*].
In recent years, this major fungal disease has decimated [$pumpkin#Plant*] yields in Northeast China (Heilongjiang Province) in increasingly numerous outbreaks with more rapid spread in recent years.
After culturing fungi on [$potato#Plant*] dextrose agar medium, we conducted a systematic study of the growth and morphological characteristics of various purified strains of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] ([$GSB#Virus*]) [$fungus#Virus*] from across Northeast China.
Subsequently, DNA samples of 30 isolates with distinct hyphal variations were subjected to internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] resulted in identification of the isolates as [$Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum#Virus*] and demonstrated that this is a dominant and widely distributed fungal species in this region.
Subsequently, multi-site [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] assigned the 30 aforementioned strains to two genotypes that aligned to seven phenotypic types of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] [$GSB#Virus*] fungi.
By analysing ITS conserved sequences of these phenotypically diverse groups, we found that[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] [$GSB#Virus*] [$pathogens#Virus*] broadly shared two motifs that contained sequence variations unique to two groups in addition to common identical motifs.
Ulti[$mate#Plant*]ly, this study provided useful data for rapid and accurate identification of [$S.cucurbitacearum#Virus*] and diagnosis in early symptoms of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] [$GSB#Virus*].
This work also provides tools to explore the distribution and regularity of [$GSB#Virus*] outbreaks spatially and temporally across Northeast China.
