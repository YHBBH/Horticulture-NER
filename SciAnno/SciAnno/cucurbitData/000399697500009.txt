Leaf samples of Cucurbita pepo with yellow mosaic disease symptoms were collected in 2012.
Rolling circle amplification and PCR amplification with begomovirus-specific primers confirmed the presence of an Old World bipartite begomovirus, an alphasatellite and a betasatellite.
Molecular analysis of full-length sequences showed that Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (DNA-A) is associated with its cognate DNA-B, Papaya leaf curl betasatellite and a novel alphasatellite.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an alphasatellite and a betasatellite associated with a bipartite begomovirus.
