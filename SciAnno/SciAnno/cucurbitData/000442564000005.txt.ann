Sources of resistance to the [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus-Florida strain#Virus*] ([@ZYMVFL#Virus*]) have been identified within the [$Citrullus genus#Plant*].
Inheritance of resistance to [$ZYMVFL#Virus*] was studied in PI 595203 ([$Citrullus mucosospermus#Plant*]), a resistant [$watermelon#Plant*] accession.
The F-1, F-2, and BC1 progenies derived from the cross 'Calhoun Gray' (CHG) x PI 595203 and 'New Hampshire Midget' (NHM) x PI 595203 were used to study the inheritance of resistance to [@ZYMV-FL#Virus*].
[$Seedlings #Plant*]were inoculated with a severe isolate of [$ZYMV-FL#Virus*] at the first true leaf stage and rated weekly for at least 6 weeks on a scale of 1 to 9 on the basis of severity of viral symptoms.
A single recessive gene (zym-FL) was found to control the high level of resistance to [$ZYMV-FL#Virus*] in PI 595203.
