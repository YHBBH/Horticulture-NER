[@P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] is cosmopolitan in distribution and one of the most common plant parasitic [$pathogen#Virus*] of a number of different [$crop#Plant*] plants in warmer parts of the world.
In the present investigation, [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] was isolated in very high frequency from different locations of Sindh province and from various sources.
The complete ITS region DNA sequence (ITS-1, 5.8S, ITS-2) and partial LSU (D1-D3) of [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] consists of 2171 base pairs (bp).
ITS-1 consisted of 174 (6-179), 5.8S of 159 (180-338), ITS-2 of 444 (339-782) and partial LSU of 1389 (783-2171) bp.
Sequences of all our [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] isolates were 99-100% identical except ML1634 which showed 98.2% similarity with ML700.
Phylogenetically, [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] belong to basal clade A of Levesque & de Cock (2004).
In ITS (ITS-1 & 2 and 5.8S) [$sequence analysis#Method*] our isolates of [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] were found to be 99-100% identical to sequences of [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] deposited in GenBank.
In present studies, [$P.aphanidermatum#Virus*] was isolated from [$millet#Plant*], [$banana#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*], [@coriander#Plant*], [$wheat#Plant*], [$sugarcane#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*], [$papaya#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$bottle gourd#Plant*], [@chilies#Plant*], [$guav#Plant*]a, [$betel#Plant*] [$vine#Plant*], [@mung bean#Plant*], [$cotton#Plant*], [$muskmelon#Plant*], [@brinjal#Plant*], [@berseem#Plant*], [$okra#Plant*] and [@radish#Plant*], as well as from [@water canal#Plant*] and [@ponds#Plant*].
