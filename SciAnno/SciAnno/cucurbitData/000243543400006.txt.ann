Greenhouse-grown [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] in several Iranian regions were surveyed for the incidence of [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [@Papaya ring spot virus-type W#Virus*]([@PRSV-W#Virus*]), [@Watermelon mosaic virus-2 #Virus*]([$WMV-2#Virus*]), [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [@Cucumber necrosis virus#Virus*] ([@CuNV#Virus*]) and [@Tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$TSWV#Virus*]) from September 2002 to June 2004.
In all, 1,304 random and 1,085 symptomatic leaf or fruit samples were collected.
Samples were analyzed for virus infection by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*].
[$CMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] were the viruses most frequently detected, accounting for 21.2 and 18% of the infected plants.
respectively.
[$WMV-2#Virus*] was detected with 4.3% incidence in 15 regions and [$TSWV#Virus*] with 1.25% incidence only in 2 regions.
[$CuNV#Virus*], [$SqMV#Virus*], and [$PRSV-W#Virus*] were not detected in any samples.
Double and triple infections involving different combinations of [$CMV#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*], [$WMV-2#Virus*], and [$TSWV#Virus*] were noted in 117 and 4 samples, respectively.
Natural infection of [$cucumber#Plant*] with [$TSWV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] is reported for the first time from Iran.
Of 16 plant species from 14 genera, growing in or around greenhouse, facilities, 6 were found infected with [$ZYMV#Virus*], [$TSWV#Virus*], [$WMV-2#Virus*], and [$CMV#Virus*] and may act as reservoirs of the viruses.
Four species are reported as new hosts of these viruses.
