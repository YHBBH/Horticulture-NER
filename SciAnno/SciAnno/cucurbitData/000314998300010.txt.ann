The use of [@next generation sequencing technologies#Method*] applied to de novo sequencing of plant genomes has resulted in a genomic revolution that is changing the way we study plant biology.
In the framework of the MELONOMICS project (www.melonomics.upv.es), the 450 Mbp genome of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) has been sequenced using a whole genome shotgun strategy with the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system.
A [@combination of 454 shotgun and paired-end reads with Sanger BAC end sequences#Method*] have been used for the assembly of the genome.
In total, more than 22 million reads representing 17.6x of the [$melon#Plant*] genome have been sequenced and assembled.
The current [$melon#Plant*] assembly contains 361 Mb (80%) of genome sequence.
The [$melon#Plant*] genome sequence will soon become a key tool for [$cucurbit #Plant*]breeders in order to improve major traits in this species.
