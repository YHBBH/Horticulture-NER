Mixed infections in [@cucurbits#Plant*] are frequently observed in natural conditions between viruses from the [$Potyvirus#Virus*] genus and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), which significantly decreases productivity.
The objectives of the present study was to compare the host range of [$PRSV-W#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*] isolates and evaluate the effects of mixed [$infe#Plant*]ctions with [$CMV#Virus*] in [$zucchini#Plant*] plants ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]).
Host range studies comprising 23 plant species confirmed some similarities and biological differences among the isolates of [$PRSV-W#Virus*], [$ZYMV#Virus*], and [$WMV#Virus*].
[$RT-PCR#Method*] confirmed the amplification of DNA fragments of the [$PRSV-W#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*], and [$ZYMV#Virus*] [$coat protein gene#Gene*] (cp) and cytoplasm inclusion gene (ci).
The virus interaction studies in [$zucchini#Plant*] Caserta plants indicated synergistic interactions, particularly among species from the [$Potyvirus#Virus*] genus, and some [$CMV#Virus*] interference with some virus combinations.
