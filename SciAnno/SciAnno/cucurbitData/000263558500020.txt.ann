Infection of [@cucumber#Plant*] with yellowing viruses or[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] has high economic impact in horticulture.
The [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) is the major agent of [$yellowing disease#Disease*].
Genebank accessions resistant to [$CYSDV#Virus*] have thus far not been identified.
[$Powdery mildew#Disease*] (PM) symptoms are caused by [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*]and [$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*].
In contrast to [$CYSDV#Virus*], various PM resistant [$cucumber#Plant*] acces[$sions#Plant*] and multiple genetic loci conferring resistance are known.
Preferably, control of [$CYSDV#Virus*] and of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] is achieved by resistant cultivars.
Resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] was identified in PI 250147, and three quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped.
The markers in each QTL-region were used to identify near-isogenic recombinants.
Two QTL were fine-mapped with this approach, one of which explained 42% of resistance.
This QTL appeared to be linked in repulsion phase to two PM resistance loci.
Recombination to physically join the three loci was detected with flanking markers in a panel of lilies harbouring resistance to both PM and [$CYSDV#Virus*].
The genetic position of QTL I for [$CYSDV#Virus*] resistance is located between two loci conferring resistance to PM.
Thus, major QTLs were combined in order to expedite breeding for resistance to closterovirus and[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
