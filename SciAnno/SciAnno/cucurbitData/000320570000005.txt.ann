 The most recent critical checklists of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] of India are 30 years old.
Since then, botanical exploration, online availability of specimen images and taxonomic literature, and molecular-phylogenetic studies have led to modified taxon boundaries and geographic ranges.
We present a checklist of the [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] of India that treats 400 relevant names and provides information on the collecting locations and herbaria for all types.
We accept 94 species (10 of them endemic) in 31 genera.
For accepted species, we provide their geographic distribution inside and outside India, links to online images of herbarium or living specimens, and information on publicly available DNA sequences to highlight gaps in the current understanding of Indian [$cucurbit #Plant*]diversity.
Of the 94 species, 79% have DNA sequences in GenBank, albeit rarely from Indian material.
The most species-rich genera are [$Trichosanthes#Plant*] with 22 species, [$Cucumis#Plant*] with 11 (all but two wild), [$Momordica#Plant*] with 8, and [$Zehneria#Plant*] with 5.
From an evolutionary point of view, India is of special interest because it harbors a wide range of lineages, many of them relatively old and phylogenetically isolated.
Phytogeographically, the north eastern and peninsular regions are richest in species, while the Jammu Kashmir and Himachal regions have few [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
Our checklist probably underestimates the true diversity of Indian [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], but should help focus efforts towards the least known species and regions.
