[@Potyviridae#Virus*] causes substantial yield losses in [$watermelon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*], and are the most frequent family of viruses reported in [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Puerto Rico.
Sampling conducted between 2006 and 2011 showed that [$PRSV#Virus*] ([$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*]) and [$ZYMV#Virus*] ([$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*]), both transmitted by [$aphids#Virus*], are the most frequent virus species infecting various [$cucurbit species #Plant*]and the invasive species [$SqVYV#Virus*] ([$Squash#Plant*] Vein Yellow [$Virus#Virus*]), transmitted by [$whitefly#Virus*], is severely affecting [$watermelons#Plant*].
The presence of [$wild cucurbit species#Plant*] provides a constant source of inoculum to [$crops#Plant*] and vice-versa.
The most common [$wild cucurbit species#Plant*] in Puerto Rico, balsam pear ([$Momordica charantia L.#Plant*]) can be found everywhere on the island.
West Indian [$gherkin#Plant*] ([@Cucumis anguria L.#Plant*]) and hedgehog [$gourd#Virus*] ([$Cucumis#Plant*] dipsaseus Ehrenb.
ex Spach), are more frequently found at lower elevations.
[$ELISA#Method*], [@immunostrip tests#Method*], [$RT-PCR#Method*] and sequencing of a [$coat protein gene#Gene*] fragment were conducted to identify and characterize viruses affecting [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Mechanical transmission to[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata 'Waltham' was conducted and symptoms were evaluated in order to select virus isolates to challenge resistant lines of [$C.moschata#Plant*].
The different virus isolates induced a broad range of symptoms to inoculated [$C.moschata#Plant*], indicating their high biological variability, which was confirmed by the genetic diversity of their sequences.
More than one virus or strain usually infects [$cucurbits#Plant*] and their potential interaction is an additional challenge to [$cucurbit #Plant*]breeding programs.
