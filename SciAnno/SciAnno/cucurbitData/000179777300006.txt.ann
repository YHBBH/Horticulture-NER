Effectiveness of UV reflective plastic mulch for the management of [@silverleaf whitefly#Virus*] ([@Bemisia argentifolii Bellows and Perring#Virus*]) was evaluated in selected [@cucurbits#Plant*].
The reflective mulch repelled [$silverleaf whitefly#Virus*] adults in [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita maxima Duchesne#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) and [$zucchini squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L#Plant*].).
Reduced colonization by [@B.argentifolii#Virus*] adults resulted in reduced populations of nymphs and a delay and reduction in the incidence of silverleaf in [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$zucchini squash#Plant*].
Reflective mulch was as effective in reducing nymphal [$B.argentifolii#Virus*] populations as was a pre-plant soil application of imidacloprid.
[$Zucchini#Plant*] [$squash#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] yields were significantly higher in plants grown over reflective mulch than in those grown over unmulched soil.
[$Zucchini#Plant*] [$squash #Plant*]yields from plants grown over reflective mulch also were higher than from plants grown in plots receiving a pre-plant application of imidacloprid.
This study confirmed that UV reflective plastic mulch can be used to manage [@R argentifolii#Virus*] and the mulches give protection equal to that provided by imidacloprid.
