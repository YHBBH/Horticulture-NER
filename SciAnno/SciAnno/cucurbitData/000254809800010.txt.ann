[@Squash leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([@SLCV#Virus*]) was detected for the first time in Jordan using degenerated oligonucleotide primers.
Two isolates of the virus, [$SLCV-E#Virus*] and [$SLCV-R#Virus*], were detected using specific oligonucleotide primers in symptomatic [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
[$SLCV#Virus*] was also found to occur naturally in Malva parviflora, which showed severe leaf curling, yellowing and stunting of the whole plants.
The full-length genomes of [@Squash leaf curl virus-Malva#Virus*] ([@SLCV-Malva#Virus*]) isolate were amplified [@using the bacteriophage Phi DNA polymerase enzyme#Method*].
[@Nucleotide sequence analysis#Method*] showed that [$SLCV-Malva#Virus*] shared high nucleotide identity (98% and 97%) with [@SLCV-EG#Virus*] and [$SLCV-E#Virus*] from Egypt and USA, respectively.
A [@survey using dot-blot hybridization#Method*] indicated that [@squash leaf curl disease#Disease*] occurred in all surveyed areas.
The highest disease incidence (95%) was recorded in Dir Alla area, whereas disease incidence did not exceed 69% in [$squash #Plant*]samples collected from North Ghor.
