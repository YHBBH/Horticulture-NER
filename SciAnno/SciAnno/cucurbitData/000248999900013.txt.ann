Isolates of two biologically and phylogenetically distinct species, referred to as [@Fusarium solani f.sp.cucurbitae race I#Virus*] (Fse-1 = Nectria haematococca mating population I [MPI]) and [@E solani f.sp.cucurbitae race 2#Virus*] (Fsc-2 = N.
haematococca mating population V [MPV]), were suspected of causing an outbreak of [@Fusarium foot and fruit rot of pumpkin during 2001 to 2003 in Connecticut, New York, Ohio, and Missouri.#Disease*]
Both species affect the fruit, but Fsc-1 also affects the crown and causes a [$stem rot#Disease*].
In this study, 156 isolates from affected plants and from soil under diseased fruit that tentatively were identified morphologically as members of the [@F.solani#Virus*] species complex were assayed for [$pathogenicity#Plant*] on [$pumpkin#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] and mature fruit.
Results of the [@pathogenicity assay#Method*] indicated that 81 of the isolates were Fsc-1.
The remaining 74 isolates were either nonpathogenic or only weakly pathogenic on the fruit.
A subset of 53 test isolates from soil and plants, plus reference isolates of Fsc-1 and Fsc-2 and an isolate from [$wheat#Plant*] reported to cause a seedling rot on [$cucurbits#Plant*], were characterized phylogenetically by sequencing a portion of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene.
A BLAST query of the FUSARIUM-ID database at Pennsylvania State University indicated that 42 of the 53 test isolates were Fsc-1, whereas none were typed as Fsc-2.
A [@polymerase chain reaction assay for mating-type (MAT) idiomorph#Method*] revealed that all of the Fsc-1 isolates were [$MAT#Method*]-1-2, suggesting that the pathogen may be strictly clonal in the affected fields.
These findings provide convincing evidence that the [$Fusarium#Virus*] foot and fruit rot outbreaks were incited by Fsc-1.
