[@Using DNA fingerprinting by pulse-field gel electrophoresis and repetitive extragenic pallindromic (REP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)#Method*], two distinct groups were confirmed among 64 [$Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] strains collected from a range of [$cucurbit#Plant*]aceous hosts in the USA, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Israel.
Eighty-two percent of the group I strains were recovered from non-[$watermelon#Plant*] hosts and the subspecies type strain was the only member of this group that utilized L-leucine as a sole carbon source.
On the contrary, 94% of the group II strains were recovered from [$watermelon#Plant*] and 96% of them utilized L-leucine.
Two-week-old [@watermelon cv.Crimson sweet#Plant*], [@cantaloupe cv.Athena#Plant*], [@pumpkin cv.Lumina#Plant*] and [@squash cv.Early yellow crookneck seedlings#Plant*] were susceptible to [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] strains representing each group with the exception of the subspecies type strain.
Overall, [$seedlings#Plant*] of [$watermelon#Plant*] cv.[$Crimson Sweet#Plant*] were most susceptible to [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] infection followed by [$cantaloupe#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*].
Group II strains were more aggressive [$watermelon#Plant*] than on other hosts.
On the contrary, group I strains were moderately aggressive on all [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts tested.
