 Olpidium radicale Schwartz and Cook fide Lange and Insunza does not encompass [$O.radicale#Virus*] Schwartz and Cook emended Cook 1935.
Thus, the combination Olpidium bornovanus (Sahtiyanci) Karling is accepted.
Single sporangial isolates of [$O.bornovanus#Virus*] and Olipidium [$brassica#Plant*]e were prepared from bulk cultures trapped on [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts using soils or roots obtained from France, California, Canada, and Brazil.
The [$O.bornovanus#Virus*] isolates comprised three host-specific strains ([$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$squash#Plant*]) based on the host in which they multiplied abundantly.
All strains reproduced moderately well in [$watermelon#Plant*], slightly in [$mung bean#Plant*], and not at all in [$lettuce#Plant*], [$cauliflower#Plant*], red clover, or timothy.
Two of three [$O.brassicae#Virus*] isolates trapped on [$melon#Plant*] had host specificity similar to that of the [$melon#Plant*] strains of [$O.bornovanus#Virus*] and the third was plurivorous.
The vegetative generation time of [$O.bornovanus#Virus*] was longer (5+ days) than that of [$O.brassicae#Virus*] (3+ days).
The [$O.bornovanus#Virus*] isolates grew at temperatures of 18-30 degrees C, whereas [$O.brassicae#Virus*] isolates did not grow at 30 degrees C.
