Since 2006, winter [@melon plants#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo L.var inodorus#Plant*]) showing symptoms of pin-point yellow spots were noticed in Sicily (Italy).
Leaf samples were tested by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] to the most important viruses-infecting [$cucurbits#Plant*].
[$Zucchini yellow fleck virus#Virus*] ([$ZYFV#Virus*], [$genus Potyvirus#Virus*]) was the only virus detected.
Surveys in 2007 and 2008 revealed an increasing number of sites in Sicily with [$ZYFV#Virus*]-infected winter [$melon plants#Plant*].
To confirm the identity of the virus as [$ZYFV#Virus*], two isolates from different locations were sequenced and shown to be approximately 85% identical to the published sequences of isolates previously identified in Italy and France.
This is the first report of [$ZYFV#Virus*] occurring on [$melon#Plant*] in Italy.
