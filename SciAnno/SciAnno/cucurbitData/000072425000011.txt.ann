Induction of tissue culture from [@Cucurbita#Plant*] andreana (CA) and [$Cucurbita#Plant*] andreana/[$Cucurbita maxima #Plant*]hybrid (CAM) was achieved and callus culture formation of [$cucurbit#Plant*]acins was measured.
Suspension culture of both [$cucurbits#Plant*] was also induced and manipulated under several growth conditions.
Tissue growth and cucurbitacin formation were improved by increasing inoculum size; cucurbitacin production increased 7- and 5-fold within the tissues and the medium respectively, over that of the initial preparation tissue weight.
An increase of phosphate level to 510 mg/l, two times above that in the Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium gave a 5-fold increase in the cucurbitacin released into the growth medium relative to medium containing 170 mg/l phosphate.
So, mass tissue formation followed by 2-fold increase of phosphate level enhanced cucurbitacin formation and release into the medium nearly 25 times the starting CA suspension culture.
