Background: [@Coccinia grandis#Virus*] ([@ivy gourd#Plant*]), is a dioecious member of [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] having heteromorphic sex chromosomes.
Chromosome constitution of male and [$female plants#Plant*] of [@C.grandis#Plant*] is 22A + XY and 22A + XX respectively.
Earlier we showed that a unique gynomonoecious form of [$C.grandis#Plant*] (22A + XX) also exists in nature bearing morphologically hermaphrodite flowers (GyM-H).
Additionally, application of silver nitrate (AgNO3) on [$female plants#Plant*] induces stamen development leading to the formation of morphologically hermaphrodite flowers (Ag-H) despite the absence of Y-chromosome.
Due to the unavailability of genome sequence and the slow pace at which sex-linked genes are identified, sex expression and modification in [$C.grandis#Plant*] are not well understood.
   Results: We have carried out a comprehensive RNA-Seq study from early-staged male, female, GyM-H, and Ag-H as well as middle-staged male and GyM-H flower buds.
A de novo transcriptome was assembled using Trinity and annotated by BLAST2GO and Trinotate pipelines.
The assembled transcriptome consisted of 467,233 'Trinity Transcripts' clustering into 378,860 'Trinity Genes'.
Female_Early_vs_Male_Early, Ag_Early_vs_Female_Early, and GyM-H_Middle_vs_Male_Middle comparisons exhibited 35,694, 3574, and 14,954 differentially expressed transcripts respectively.
Further, [@qRT-PCR analysis#Method*] of selected candidate genes validated digital gene expression profiling results.
Interestingly, ethylene response-related genes were found to be upregulated in female buds compared to male buds.
Also, we observed that AgNO3 treatment suppressed ethylene responses in Ag-H flowers by downregulation of ethylene-responsive transcription factors leading to stamen development.
Further, GO terms related to stamen development were enriched in early-staged male, GyM-H, and Ag-H buds compared to female buds supporting the fact that stamen growth gets arrested in female flowers.
   Conclusions: Suppression of ethylene responses in both male and Ag-H compared to female buds suggests a probable role of ethylene in stamen suppression similar to monoecious [$cucurbits#Plant*] such as [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
Also, pollen fertility associated GO terms were depleted in middle-staged GyM-H buds compared to male buds indicating the necessity of Y-chromosome for pollen fertility.
Overall, this study would enable identification of new sex-biased genes for further investigation of stamen arrest, pollen fertility, and AgNO3-mediated sex modification.
