[@Cucurbita moschata cv.#Plant*]
Nigerian Local has been used as a source of resistance to [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [@Papaya ringspot virus W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) in breeding both [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] and [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
We used the F-1, F-2 and BC1 generations derived from the cross [@C.-moschata cv#Plant*].
Waltham Butternut x Nigerian Local to study the inheritance of resistance to each of the viruses.
We confirmed monogenic dominant resistance to [$ZYMV#Virus*] previously attributed to Zym, and we report monogenic dominant resistance to [$WMV#Virus*] and [$CMV#Virus*] which we propose to designate Wmv and Cmv, respectively.
A single recessive gene, which we propose to designate prv, controls resistance to [$PRSV#Virus*].
DNA samples were extracted from a Waltham Butternut BC, F, population screened with [$ZYMV#Virus*] and analyzed using randomly amplified polymorphic [$DNA marker#Method*]s.
No [@RAPD markers#Method*] linked to [$ZYMV#Virus*] resistance were found.
