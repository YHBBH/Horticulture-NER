Since 2001, several isolates of [@Blumeria graminis#Virus*], the causal agent of cereal [$powdery mildew#Disease*], maintained on detached leaves at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, have spontaneously become infected with an unknown filamentous [$fungus#Virus*] whose mycelia have quickly overgrown the [$powdery mildew#Disease*] colonies and destroyed them completely.
A total of five isolates of the contaminant were obtained and identified as [@Paecilomyces farinosus#Virus*] based on [@morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS sequence data#Method*].
To determine whether these [@P.farinosus#Virus*] isolates can be considered as biocontrol agents (BCAs) of [@powdery mildews#Disease*], we studied the interactions between [$P.farinosus#Virus*] and the following four [$powdery mildew#Disease*] species: [@B.graminis f.sp.hordei#Virus*] infecting [$barley#Plant*], [@Oidium neolycopersici#Virus*] infecting [$tomato#Plant*], [@Golovinomyces orontii#Virus*] infecting [$tobacco#Plant*] and [$Podosphaera fusca#Virus*] infecting [$cucumber#Plant*].
The [$powdery mildew#Disease*] colonies of all these four [$powdery mildew#Disease*] species were quickly destroyed by [$P.farinosus#Virus*] in leaf cultures but neither [$conidia#Virus*]l suspensions nor cell-free culture filtrates of [$P.farinosus#Virus*] isolates could suppress the spread of [$powdery mildew#Disease*] infections on diseased [$barley#Plant*], [$tomato#Plant*], [$tobacco#Plant*] or [$cucumber#Plant*] plants in the greenhouse.
It is concluded that [$P.farinosus#Virus*] cannot be considered as a promising BCA of [$powdery mildew#Disease*] infections although it can destroy [$powdery mildew#Disease*] colonies in detached leaf cultures and can be a menace during the maintenance of such cultures of cereal, [$apple#Plant*], [$cucurbit#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] [$powdery mildew#Disease*] isolates.
