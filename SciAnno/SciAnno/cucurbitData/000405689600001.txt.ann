[@Root-knot nematodes (RKN)#Disease*] are yield devastating plant [$pathogens#Virus*].
Objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of [$RKN#Virus*] and their threat to [$vegetable#Plant*] production in the Pakistani-administered districts of Muzaffarabad, Hattian Bala and Neelum.
A survey in more than 130 [$vegetable#Plant*] fields during summer 2012, 2013 and 2014 revealed a remarkable occurrence and prevalence of [$RKN#Virus*] in many [$vegetable crops#Plant*].
[$RKN#Virus*] were found in 64 % of the fields in Muzaffarabad, 30 % of the fields in Hattian Bala and 24 % of the fields in Neelum.
Okra was infested on 26 sites with a gall index range of 3-10, [$tomato#Plant*] on 26 sites with a gall index of 2-10, [$cucumber#Plant*] at 13 sites with a gall index of 3-9 and [$eggplant#Plant*] at 11 sites with a gall index of 3-9.
Other hosts infested by [$RKN#Virus*] included [$mint#Plant*], [$beans#Plant*], [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [@peach#Plant*].
Identification of [$RKN#Virus*] species was performed morphologically by perineal patterns, by [$PCR#Method*] using primers for the IGS2 region or SCAR primers, and some by sequencing of a COI gene fragment.
The [$RKN#Virus*] of this temperate region were mostly identified as tropical species.
[$M.incognita#Virus*] was found in 83 % of the tested fields followed by [$M.javanica#Virus*] (76 %) and [$M.arenaria#Virus*] (36 %).
[$M.javanica#Virus*] was the predominant species in Muzaffarabad and Hattian Bala.
This is the first comprehensive study on the presence of tropical [$RKN#Virus*] species in the temperate region of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, and their virulence on [$vegetable crops#Plant*].
