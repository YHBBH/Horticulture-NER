During a search for [@cucurbit viruses #Virus*]in NWFP, a very severe disease of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) characterized by leaf curling, chlorotic spots, vein clearing, mosaic, leaf distortion and enations on the upper leaf surface was identified in commercial fields in Mardan District, NWFP.
Symptomatic plants were screened for the presence of [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) by [@double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immounosorbent assay#Method*] ([$DAS-ELISA#Method*]).
Plants were also tested for the presence of [$begomoviruses#Virus*] by [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] and [$Southern hybridization#Method*] using general probes.
No sample was found positive for [$begomoviruses#Virus*].
The presence of [$CMV#Virus*] and [$ZYMV#Virus*] was confirmed by [$DAS-ELISA#Method*].
Our results show that the severe disease found on [$melon#Plant*] in Mardan district is caused by multiple infections of two viruses and the severity result from synergism between two viruses.
