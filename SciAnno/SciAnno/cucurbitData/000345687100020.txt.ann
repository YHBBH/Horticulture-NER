Seventeen pathogenic races were identified in axenic culture among 18 Czech isolates of [$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*] (Gc, six isolates) and [$Podosphaera xanthii #Virus*](Px, 12 isolates) on a set of 21 [$melon#Plant*] [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*] ([$CPM#Virus*]) race differentials and using a triplet septet code.
The 18 isolates were collected in 2010 from four [$cucurbit species#Plant*]:[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] (10 isolates), [@Cucurbita maxima#Plant*] (four isolates), [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] (two isolates) and [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] (one isolate).
The results of this research are interesting from several views.
One, the diversity for [$pathogenicity#Plant*] among the isolates of the two [$CPM#Virus*] [$pathogens#Virus*] on the [$melon#Plant*] [$CPM#Virus*] race differentials.
The [$pathogen#Virus*]ic diversity of among these isolates confirmed that Czech [$CPM#Virus*] populations are unique, and highly variable in race structure.
There was no obvious relationship between source species and race identity for either [$CPM#Virus*] species.
Two, the concomitant reactions of the 21 [$melon#Plant*] differentials reveal a rich reservoir of potentially useful [$CPM#Virus*] resistance genes for pyramiding.
Three, the distinct differences in reactions by two pairs of closely related [$melon#Plant*] lines thought to be equivalent in their genes for resistance to Px emphasize the complexity of host plant resistance to [$CPM#Virus*].
Differentials PI 234607, 'PMR 6', PI 124112, MR-1, and PI 124111 exhibited broad resistance to Gc and Px.
