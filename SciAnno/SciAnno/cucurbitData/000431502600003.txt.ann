[@Monosporascus cannonballus#Virus*] is an important [$cucurbit #Plant*]root [$pathogen#Virus*], which has been reported in the main production areas of [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] in Brazil and worldwide and potentially capable to colonize roots of different species.
Crop rotation is considered an effective management strategy to prevent this disease.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of different [$crops#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], [$cotton#Plant*], [$cowpea#Plant*], [$sesame#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$corn#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$sorghum#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*], to the [$infe#Plant*]ction of this [$pathogen#Virus*].
[$Seedlings #Plant*]were transplanted into plastic containers with an inoculum concentration of 20 colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) of [$M.cannonballus#Virus*].
Fifty days after transplanting, the variables analysed were the degree of disease severity on the root system and the frequency of reisolation.
On [$cucurbits#Plant*], the results demonstrated different degrees of susceptibility among [$crops#Plant*] and cultivars, being [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] the most sensitive species.
In contrast,[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] cultivars were the most tolerant.
Regarding non-[$cucurbit crops#Plant*], [$maize#Plant*], [$sorghum#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] presented root discoloration and [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] was reisolated from roots.
[@Cotton#Plant*], [$cowpea#Plant*] and [$sesame#Plant*] cultivars were not affected by the [$pathogen#Virus*], so they can be considered as [$alternative crops#Plant*] to be cultivated, or in rotation with [$cucurbits#Plant*], in [$M.cannonballus#Virus*] infested soils.
