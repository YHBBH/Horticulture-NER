To improve the simultaneous detection of two pathogens in [@cucurbit #Plant*]seed, a combination of magnetic capture hybridization (MCH) and [@multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) was developed.
Single-stranded DNA hybridization capture probes targeting DNA of [@Acidovorax avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*], causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*], and [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*], causal agent of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*], were covalently attached to magnetic particles and used to selectively concentrate template DNA from [$cucurbit #Plant*]seed samples.
Sequestered template DNAs were subsequently amplified by [@multiplex real-time PCR#Method*] using[@ pathogen-specific TaqMan PCR assays#Method*].
The MCH [@multiplex real-time PCR assay#Method*] displayed a detection threshold of [@A.avenae subsp.citrulliat#Virus*] 10 CFU/ml and [$D.bryoniae#Virus*] at 10(5) [$conidia#Virus*]/ml in mixtures of pure cultures of the two [$pathogens#Virus*], which was 10-fold more sensitive than the [@[$direct real-time PCR assays#Method*]#Method*]#Method* for the two [$[$pathogens#Virus*] separately.
Although the [@direct real-time PCR assay#Method*] displayed a detection threshold for [@A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] DNA of 100 fg/mu l in 25% (1/4 samples) of the samples assayed, MCH [@real-time PCR#Method*] demonstrated 100% detection frequency (4/4 samples) at the same DNA concentration.
MCH did not improve detection sensitivity for [@D.bryoniae #Virus*]relative to direct [$real-time PCR#Method*] using [$conidia#Virus*]l suspensions or seed washes from [@D.bryoniae#Virus*]-infested [$cucurbit #Plant*]seed.
However, MCH [$real-time PCR#Method*] facilitated detection of both target [$pathogens#Virus*] in [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*] seed samples (n = 5,000 seeds/sample) in which 0.02% of the seed were infested with [$A.avenae subsp.citrulli#Virus*] and 0.02% were infested with [@D.ryoniae#Virus*].
