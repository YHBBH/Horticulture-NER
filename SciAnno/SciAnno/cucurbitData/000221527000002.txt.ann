'Charleston Belle', a [@root-knot nematode#Virus*]-resistant [@pepper#Plant*] ([@Capsicum annuum var.annuum#Plant*] [[@Grossum Group#Plant*]]), and its susceptible recurrent parent, 'Keystone Resistant Giant', were Compared as spring [$crops#Plant*] for managing the southern [$root-knot nematode#Virus*] ([$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*]) in fall-[$crop#Plant*]ped [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) and [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]) at Blackville, SC and Tifton, GA.
'Charleston Belle' exhibited minimal root galling and nematode reproduction, and 'Keystone Resistant Giant' exhibited severe root galling and high nematode reproduction.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] grown in plots following '[$Charleston Belle#Virus*]' had lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) root gall severity indices than following 'Keystone Resistant Giant' (4.2 versus 4.9, respectively).
[$Cucumber#Plant*] yields were 87% heavier (P less than or equal to 0.0001) and numbers of fruit were 85% higher (P less than or equal to 0.0001) in plots previously planted to 'Charleston Belle' than to 'Keystone Resistant Giant'.
[$Squash#Plant*] grown in plots following 'Charleston Belle' had lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) root gall severity indices than following 'Keystone Resistant Giant' (4.0 versus 4.8, respectively).
[$Squash#Plant*] yields were 55% heavier (P less than or equal to 0.01) and numbers of fruit were 50% higher (P less than or equal to 0.001) in plots previously planted to 'Charleston Belle' than to 'Keystone Resistant Giant'.
These results demonstrate that [$root-knot nematode#Virus*]-resistant bell [$pepper#Plant*] cultivars such as 'Charleston Belle' are useful tools for managing M.incognita in double-[$crop#Plant*]ping systems with [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
