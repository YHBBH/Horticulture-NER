 The spatial separation of male and female functions achieved by monoecy has been proposed as a mechanism to avoid selfing.
 In the self-compatible, monoecious [@Apodanthera undulata#Plant*], pistillate and staminate flowers often bloom on the same day and floral ratios are male-biased (20:1).
 The two types of flowers do not differ in nectar composition or UV reflectance, but pistillate flowers are larger, often contain more nectar, and are more common at the later nodes of the branches of this plant.
 Possibly because of these differences, pollinators showed a slight preference for pistillate flowers.
 This preference resulted in pistillate flowers being visited first on 30.7% and second on 5.7% of all visits observed.
 Thus, the pollinators' preference for pistillate flowers should increase outcrossing rates in this species.
