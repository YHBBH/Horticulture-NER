NAC (no apical meristem, [@Arabidopsis#Plant*] transcription activation factor 1 and 2, cup-shaped cotyledon 2) transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress.
Two novel NAC TFs were isolated from [$Citrullus colocynthis#Plant*], a highly drought-tolerant [$cucurbit species#Plant*]: [@CcNAC1#Gene*] and [@CcNAC2#Gene*] each with conserved A-E NAC domains.
[@Subcellular location#Method*] of [$CcNAC1#Gene*] and [$CcNAC2#Gene*] investigated [@via transient expression of 35S::CcNAC1::GFP and 35S::CcNAC2::GFP fusion constructs in Arabidopsis protoplasts#Method*], revealed nuclear localization.
The transactivation ability of [@CcNACs#Gene*] was examined in the [@GAL4 yeast assay system#Method*], and showed that only the C-terminal domain of [$CcNAC1#Gene*] has the ability to activate reporter genes [@LacZ#Gene*] and [@His3#Gene*].
The [@CcNAC genes#Gene*] accumulated in a tissue-specific manner with expression levels in male flowers of [$C.colocynthis#Plant*] higher than leaves, hypocotyls or roots.
Genome walking was used to isolate the [$CcNAC1#Gene*] and [$CcNAC2#Gene*]-promoter regions.
A high number of stress-related sequence motifs were detected, especially in the [$CcNAC1#Gene*] promoter.[$C.colocynthis#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] were treated with PEG, abscisic acid, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), H2O2, ethylene, gibberellic acid (GA), wounding or salt.
High [$CcNAC1#Gene*] expression levels were detected following JA application, and wounding, while high [$CcNAC2#Gene*] levels followed treatment with GA, JA, SA, and wounding, indicative of differential regulation of these stress responsive TFs in this [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
