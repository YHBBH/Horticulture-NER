Fifty-one [@melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) accessions that originated from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were evaluated for resistance to [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]), a newly emerged species in the [$genus Crinivirus#Virus*].
[$CCYV#Virus*] was inoculated using [$sweet potato#Plant*] [$whitefly#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]) biotype Q.
Accessions, JP 138332, JP 216154, JP 216155, JP 216751 and JP 91204, showed no or faint symptoms, although [$CCYV#Virus*] was detected from the non-inoculated upper leaves by [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]).
The five accessions were subjected to quantitative [$RT-PCR#Method*] to analyze relative accumulation of [$CCYV#Virus*] RNA.
All accessions except JP 138332 had levels of [$CCYV#Virus*] RNA accumulation comparable to the commercial variety, 'Earl's Seine', which was used as a control.
JP 138332 showed a much lower [$CCYV#Virus*] RNA accumulation.
Numbers of B.
tabaci biotype Q on JP 138332 did not differ from 'Earl's Seine', in antixenosis tests, and the result suggested the resistance to [$CCYV#Virus*] was not due to antixenosis.
Consequently, five accessions are of interest for development of resistant varieties.
In particular, JP 138332 possesses a promising resistant trait for [$CCYV#Virus*], which might be associated with inhibition of virus multiplication.
