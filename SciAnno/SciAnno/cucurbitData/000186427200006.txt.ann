[@Downy mildew#Disease*], incited by the oomycete [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] ([@Berk.et Curt.#Virus*]) Rost., was recorded in Israel during the years 1979-2001 on [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]) and [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and classified as pathotype 3.
In July 2002 severe outbreaks of [$downy Mildew#Disease*] occurred on [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]) and [$summer squash#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita pepo subsp.pepo#Plant*]).
[@Host range pathogenicity studies#Method*] revealed high compatibility of the new population with [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$summer squash#Plant*] but low compatibility with [$watermelon#Plant*].
This new population was therefore designated as pathotype 6.
The possible origin of this new pathotype in Israel is discussed.
