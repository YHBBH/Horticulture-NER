Three separate field trials were conducted to determine the most appropriate planting dates for intercropping [@cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), [$summer squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*]), and [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) with [$strawberry#Plant*] ([$Fragaria xananassa#Plant*]), and their effect on 'Strawberry Festival' [$strawberry#Plant*] yields.
'Straight Eight' [$cucumber#Plant*], 'Crookneck' [$summer squash#Plant*], and 'Athena' [$muskmelon#Plant*] were planted every 15 days from 25 Jan.
to 23 March.
None of the three intercropped species affected [$strawberry#Plant*] yield up to 60 days before the end of the season on 25 March.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] yield responded quadratically to planting dates, rapidly increasing from 25 Jan.
to 23 Feb.
and declining afterward.
Warmer temperatures favored [$summer squash#Plant*] yield, with the highest yields when planted on 23 Feb.
or later.
[$Muskmelon#Plant*] yields decreased as air temperatures increased, and the best planting dates were between 25 Jan.
and 9 Feb.
In summary, [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$summer squash#Plant*] seemed to be favored by planting under warmer temperatures, whereas [$muskmelon#Plant*] thrives under cooler weather.
