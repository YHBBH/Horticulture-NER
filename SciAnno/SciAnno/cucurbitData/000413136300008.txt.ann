[@Gummy stem blight#Disease*] can develop in greenhouses on [$cucurbit #Plant*][$seedlings#Plant*] grown as scions and rootstocks for grafting.
When diseased [$seedlings#Plant*] are cut during grafting, [$Stagonosporopsis spp.#Virus*], the [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] causing [$gummy stem blight#Disease*], may be transferred to healthy [$seedlings#Plant*].
The objective of this study was to evaluate efficacy of disinfectant treatments to prevent or reduce transmission during cutting and grafting.
A blade contaminated with mycelium and spores from a culture of [$S.citrulli#Virus*] transferred the [$pathogen#Virus*] to 72%, 73%, and 55% of the second, third, and fourth [$seedlings#Plant*], respectively, cut in sequence when 100% of the first [$seedlings#Plant*] cut were infected.
Kleengro (didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride), Physan 20 (dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride), and Virkon S (potassium peroxymonosulfate) were ineffective when sprayed onto [$watermelon seedlings#Plant*] before or after cutting hypocotyls with a contaminated blade.
Dipping a contaminated blade in 0.3% sodium hypochlorite, 0.4% Physan 20, or 70% or 95% ethanol before cutting [$watermelon#Plant*] hypocotyls significantly (P = 0.01) reduced incidence of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] compared with water but did not prevent transmission.
Soaking a contaminated blade for 3 s in 95% ethanol, 30 s in 0.8% sodium hypochlorite, or flaming the blade after dipping in 95% ethanol, prevented transmission.
In a [$grafting experiment#Method*], both the [$watermelon#Plant*] scion and the interspe[$cific hyb#Method*]rid [$squash #Plant*]rootstock were cut with contaminated or contaminated and treated blades before grafting.
Sterilizing a contaminated blade by flaming significantly (P = 0.01) reduced incidence of gummy stem when compared with a 1-s dip in ethanol, a 1-s dip in Physan 20, or water.
Disease incidences in these treatments were 11%, 45%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.
Using heat, ethanol, or sodium hypochlorite to disinfest cutting tools may reduce transmission of [$S.citrulli#Virus*] during [$cucurbit #Plant*]grafting.
