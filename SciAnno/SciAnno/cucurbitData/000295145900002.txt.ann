BACKGROUND: [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], the causal oomycete agent of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*], is responsible for enormous [$crop#Plant*] losses in many species of [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*], particularly in [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*].
Disease control is mainly achieved by combinations of host resistance and fungicide applications.
However, since 2004, resistance to [$downy mildew#Virus*] in [$cucumber#Plant*] has been overcome by the [$pathogen#Virus*], thus driving farmers to rely only on fungicide spray applications, including carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicides.
Recently, CAA-resistant isolates of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]were recovered, but the underlying mechanism of resistance was not revealed.
The purpose of the present study was to identify the molecular mechanism controlling resistance to CAAs in [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
   RESULTS: The four CesA (cellulose synthase) genes responsible for cellulose biosynthesis in [$P.cubensis #Virus*]were characterised.
Resistant strains showed a mutation in the CesA3 gene, at position 1105, leading to an amino acid exchange from glycine to valine or tryptophan.
Cross-resistance tests with different CAAs indicated that these mutations lead to resistance against all tested CAAs.
   CONCLUSION: Point mutations in the CesA3 gene of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]lead to CAA resistance.
Accurate monitoring of these mutations among [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations may improve/facilitate adequate recommendation/deployment of fungicides in the field.
