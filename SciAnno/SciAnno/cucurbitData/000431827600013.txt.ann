Several outbreaks of [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] have been observed recently in Poland.
Based on the [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of the genes' encoding movement and [$coat protein#Gene*], [@Polish CMV#Virus*] isolates from [$zucchini#Plant*] were classified into two subgroups: IA and II.
A reverse transcription, loop-mediated amplification method ([$RT-LAMP#Method*]) was developed for rapid and effective detection of genetically diverse [$CMV#Virus*] isolates.
[$RT-LAMP#Method*] was performed with a set of six primers, the design of which was based on the [$coat protein gene#Gene*].
Positive effects of the [$RT-LAMP#Method*] were visualized by direct staining of the reaction with fluorescent dyes, [$agarose gel electrophoresis#Method*], and analysis of the amplification curves in real-time conditions.
The [$RT-LAMP#Method*] method developed here was capable of the detection of diverse [$CMV#Virus*] isolates in less than 1 h.
The sensitivity of [$RT-LAMP#Method*] was tenfold higher than that of conventional [$RT-PCR#Method*].
