Grafting is a common practice in many countries and, after the phase out of methyl bromide as fumigant, it is more widely used to control a number of diseases on [$solanaceous #Plant*]and [$cucurbits#Plant*].
There is evidence of a pathogenic variation among some isolates of [@Phytophthora spp.#Virus*]
on [$solanaceous crops#Plant*] and on rootstocks and the development of new diseases or the re-emergence of already known [$pathogens#Virus*] such as [@Colletotrichum coccodes#Virus*] and [$Rhizoctonia solani#Virus*].
   The susceptibility of several commercial rootstocks of [$bell pepper#Plant*] to [$soilborne pathogens#Virus*] was evaluated both, in glasshouse under artificial inoculation of [$P.capsici#Plant*], [$R.solani#Virus*], [$Verticillium dahliae#Virus*] and [@C.coccodes#Virus*] obtained from infected [$bell pepper#Plant*] plants.
The results described in this work show that some of the rootstocks are susceptible to one or more pathogens.
The critical aspects of grafting for [$soilborne pathogens#Virus*] of [$bell pepper#Plant*] are discussed.
