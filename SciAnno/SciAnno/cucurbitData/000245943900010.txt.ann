Relative nuclear DNA content was assessed in 14 [@cucurbit#Plant*] accessions derived from three genera ([$Cucurbita#Virus*], [$Citrullus#Plant*], and [$Cucumis#Plant*]), using flow cytometry based on the [@DAPI staining technique#Method*] and [@soybean#Plant*] ([@Glycine max cv.Polanka#Plant*]) as an internal standard.
Relative nuclear DNA content ranged from 0.783 in an accession of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] pepo to 0.996 in an accession of [$Cucumis melo#Plant*].
Significant differences in relative nuclear DNA content were found among genera and among accessions of [@Cucurbita pepo#Plant*].
