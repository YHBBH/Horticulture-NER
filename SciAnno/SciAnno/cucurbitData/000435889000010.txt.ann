[@Powdery mildew (PM)#Disease*] is a major foliar disease causing serious economic losses of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] grown in the United States.
The [$pathogen#Virus*] [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*], which causes PM, is known to infect [$seedlings#Plant*], stems, foliage, petioles, and fruit of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
In recent years, grafting [$watermelon#Plant*] on resistant rootstocks for managing soilbome diseases has been gaining popularity in the U.S.A.
However, grafting for managing [$foliar diseases#Disease*] has not yet received adequate attention.
Three [$greenhouse experiments#Method*] were conducted during the summer months of 2012, 2013, and 2014 to determine if PM-resistant rootstocks could impart resistance to a susceptible [$watermelon#Plant*] scion.
Susceptible [$watermelon#Plant*] scion 'Mickey Lee' [$seedlings#Plant*] were grafted onto 25 [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*], [@C.amarus#Plant*], [@C.mucosospennus#Plant*]) and four [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) rootstocks.
Grafted plants were inoculated with a 2 x 10(4) [$conidia#Virus*] ml(-1) suspension of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] [$conidia#Virus*] and disease severity was rated 14 days after inoculation.
Mickey Lee grafted on six PM-resistant [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstocks had significantly (P <= 0.05) lower PM severity on cotyledons, 2nd true leaf, and upper leaves (rating for 3rd to 7th or 8th true leaf) compared with Mickey Lee grafted on susceptible [$watermelon#Plant*] USVL677-PMS or [$bottle gourd#Plant*] USVL848-PMS rootstocks.
However, some of the resistant [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstocks did not impart significant resistance to the scion.
The resistant [$bottle gourd#Plant*] rootstocks USVL482-PMR and USVL351-PMR provided significantly greater levels of resistance, compared with many of the resistant [$watermelon#Plant*] rootstocks.
[$Grafting watermelon#Plant*] on resistant rootstocks may help mitigate the effects of PM on susceptible scion [$seedlings#Plant*].
