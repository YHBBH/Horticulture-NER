Surveys of [@yellowing viruses#Virus*] in plastic tunnels and in open [$field crops#Plant*] of [$melon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo cultivar catalupo#Plant*]), [@oriental melon#Plant*] ([@C.melo cultivar oriental melon#Plant*]), and [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$C.sativus#Plant*]) were carried out in two [$melon#Plant*]-growing areas in 2014, Korea.
Severe yellowing symptoms on older leaves of [$melon#Plant*] and chlorotic spots on younger leaves of [$melon#Plant*] were observed in the plastic tunnels.
The symptoms were widespread and included initial chlorotic lesions followed by yellowing of whole leaves and thickening of older leaves.
[@RT-PCR analysis using total RNA extracted from diseased leaves #Method*]did not show any synthesized products for four [$cucurbit-infecting viruses#Virus*]; [$Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*], [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*], [@Cucurbit yellows stunting disorder virus#Virus*], and [$Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*].
[$Virus#Virus*] identification [$using RT-PCR#Method*] showed [@Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows Virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) was largely distributed in [$melon#Plant*], [$oriental melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
This result was verified by [$aphid#Virus*] ([$Aphis gossypii#Virus*]) transmission of [$CABYV#Virus*].
The complete [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) gene amplified from [$melon#Plant*] was cloned and sequenced.
The [$CP#Gene*] gene nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence comparisons as well as [$phylogenetic tree#Method*] analysis of [$CABYV#Virus*] [$CP#Gene*]s showed that the [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates were undivided into subgroups.
Although the low incidence of [$CABYV#Virus*] in infections to [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in this survey, [$CABYV#Virus*] may become an important treat for [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in many different regions in Korea, suggesting that [$CABYV#Virus*] should be taken into account in disease control of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Korea.
