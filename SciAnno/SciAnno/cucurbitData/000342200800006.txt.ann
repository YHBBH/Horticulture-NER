Yellowing symptoms of greenhouse-and open field-grown cucurbit crops are becoming increasingly important in many cucurbit growing regions of the world, and particularly in Iran.
A survey was conducted from 2011 to 2012 in eight major [$cucurbit #Plant*]growing regions in Iran.
Yellowing and specifically vein clearing symptoms were observed in many [$cucumber plants#Plant*] grown in greenhouses and open fields, suggesting the presence of [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*], [$genus Ipomovirus#Virus*], [$family Potyviridae#Virus*]).
The identification of [$CVYV#Virus*] was carried out with a specific triple-antibody sandwich [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([@TAS-ELISA#Method*]) and [@reverse transcription (RT)-PCR#Method*].
[$CVYV#Virus*] was detected in 42% of the collected samples, in all surveyed provinces, except Bushehr.
[$CVYV#Virus*] was also detected in [$melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber crops#Plant*] grown in open fields.
These results indicate that [$CVYV#Virus*] is widely distributed on these two [$cucurbit species #Plant*]in the major [$cucumber#Plant*] growing areas of Iran.
[$CVYV#Virus*] positive samples were also tested, using [$DAS-ELISA#Method*], for the presence of [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), two criniviruses reported previously to occur in Iran.
Double or triple infections of [$CCYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] occurred in 49 of 166 of the [$CVYV#Virus*]-infected plants.
The [$CVYV#Virus*] and [$CCYV#Virus*] combined infections were more prevalent than [$CVYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] combined infections.
[$TAS-ELISA#Method*] positive samples were used to mechanically inoculate healthy [$cucumber plants#Plant*], and mild vein yellowing was observed on the inoculated leaves.
Identical symptoms were also observed on [$whitefly#Virus*] inoculated healthy [$cucumber plants#Plant*].
The presence of [$CVYV#Virus*] in mechanically and [$whitefly#Virus*] inoculated plants was confirmed by [$TAS-ELISA#Method*] and [$RT-PCR#Method*].
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] revealed that the Iranian isolate of [$CVYV#Virus*] was more closely related to Spanish isolates than to isolates from Jordan.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] showed that [$CVYV#Virus*] isolates can be divided into two phylogenetic groups (I and II).
Despite the close vicinity of Jordan to Iran, the Iranian [$CVYV#Virus*] isolate clustered with Spanish isolates in group I and not with the Jordanian isolates of group II.
