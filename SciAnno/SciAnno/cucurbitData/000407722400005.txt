cPumpkins and squashes (Cucurbita moschata and Cucurbita maxima) are important crops in Brazil.
In the recent decades, Central Brazil is increasing its importance as a cucurbit-producing region.
An interspecific hybrid known as 'Tetsukabuto' or 'Cabotia', originated from a cross between a C.
maxima female inbred line and a C.
moschata male inbred line stands out among the most commercialized varieties in the Country.
The objective was to evaluate the agronomic performance of experimental interspecific Tetsukabuto hybrids through direct evaluation and through the correlation between fruit characteristics, in Central Plateau of Brazil.
Eight fruit traits were evaluated in 35 interspecific experimental hybrid combinations in a field assay carried out in Brasilia.
These hybrids were derived from crosses involving the elite C.
maxima inbred line CNPH 0739 and 35 C.
moschata inbred lines.
The characteristics evaluated were total fruit yield, number of fruits per plant, average fruit weight, length and diameter of fruit, soluble solids content, fruit pulp thickness and shell thickness.
Fruit yield was found to be positively correlated with a higher number of fruits per plant, higher average fruit weight, higher flesh thickness and higher fruit diameter.
However, no significant correlation was observed with fruit length.
Fruits with the highest average weight displayed lower (o)Brix.
The experimental hybrid CNPH 2377 stood out for the characteristics and showed high productivity of fruits (21.98 t/ha), average fruit weight over 3 kg, about 4 fruits per plant, with thick pulp (34.41 mm), thin shell (2.17 mm) and acceptable content of soluble solids (17.01 degrees Brix).
In this context, our results indicated that it is feasible to develop new genetic materials from the variety group Tetsukabuto, combining superior agronomic traits as well as adaptation to the highland areas of Central Brazil.
