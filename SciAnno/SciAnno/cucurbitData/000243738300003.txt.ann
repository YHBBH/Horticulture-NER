In a survey in field-grown [@cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) of the Spreewald cultivation area, Germany, from 2001 to 2004, infection with [$zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [@watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [$cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) and [$cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CGMMV#Virus*]) were recorded.
[$ZYMV#Virus*] was of most relevance, owing to its damaging effects and frequency.
[$Pumpkin#Plant*]s ([$Cucurbita pepo L#Plant*].
and [@Cucurbita maxima Duchesne#Plant*]) were also found to be infected.
   In glasshouse experiments with 27 fresh and pickle [$cucumber#Plant*] cultivars frequently cultivated in the area, all cultivars proved (after [$mechanical inoculation#Method*]) to be susceptible to [$ZYMV#Virus*].
[$ZYMV#Virus*]-infected [$cucumbers#Plant*] showed leaf chlorosis and mosaic, as well as deformation of leaves and fruits.
Mechanical inoculation with [$ZYMV#Virus*], in the early developmental stages of [@cucumber plants#Plant*], reduced yields by up to 70%.
Mixed infection with [$ZYMV#Virus*] and [$CMV#Virus*] resulted in synergistic effects, increasing the severity of damage.
Fruit and leaf deformation also occurred in [$cucumber#Plant*] cultivars exhibiting a documented tolerance to [$CMV#Virus*].
   The widespread [@weeds fat hen#Plant*] ([@Chenopodium album L.#Plant*]) and [@hoary alison#Plant*] ([@Berteroa incana (L.) DC.#Plant*]) were identified as possible sources of natural [$ZYMV#Virus*] infection in the Spreewald region.
[$ZYMV#Virus*] transmission through seed seems to be of no importance, and possible only if fresh seeds from diseased [$cucumbers#Plant*] or [$pumpkins#Plant*] are used (commercially available seed is not contaminated).
Uptake of [$ZYMV#Virus*] through contaminated soil is not a major mode of natural virus transmission, even though it proved possible in baiting experiments.
Epidemiologic and economic implications of [$ZYMV#Virus*] infections of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*] plants are discussed.
