In a survey during 2000-2002 to determine the identity and prevalence of viruses affecting [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Cyprus, 2993 samples of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$zucchini#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] were collected from the five major [$cucurbit#Plant*]-growing areas in Cyprus.
[$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [@Papaya ringspot virus type W#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]), [@Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) and [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]) were detected by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] ([$ELISA#Method*]), and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), [$Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) by [@reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]).
[$ZYMV#Virus*] was the most prevalent virus of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Cyprus with an overall incidence of 45%.
[$PRSV-W#Virus*], [$CABYV#Virus*] and [$WMV#Virus*] were detected in 20.8%, 20.8% and 7.8% of the samples tested, respectively.
[$CYSDV#Virus*] was detected in most greenhouse [$cucumber#Plant*] samples with yellowing symptoms (88.1%), whereas [$BPYV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*] were found in only 2.4% and 9.5%, respectively, of samples.
[$CMV#Virus*] and [$SqMV#Virus*] were not detected in any [$cucurbit#Plant*]aceous [$crop#Plant*] during this survey.
