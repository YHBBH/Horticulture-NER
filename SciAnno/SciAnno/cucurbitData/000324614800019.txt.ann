Many persistent organic pollutants (POPs), notably hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlorinated cyclodienes, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), remain in Japanese farming soils, more than 40 years after their use as insecticides was prohibited.
In recent years, residues of chlorinated cyclodienes in cucurbit fruits have become a problem.
But, though HCHs and DDTs have been staying in the soil, residues of these chemicals in [$crops#Plant*] have not been a problem.
So we compared the fates of HCHs (alpha-, beta-, gamma-HCHs), chlorinated cyclodienes (dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor exo-epoxide), and DDTs (DDE, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; DDD, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) in soil and investigated their uptake by several non-[$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*].
As for the fate of POPs in soil, not only the total concentrations but also the concentrations in soil solution as bioavailable POPs were determined.
The half-lives of total beta-HCH and DDTs in soil were the longest, and alpha- and gamma-HCHs the shortest.
On the other hand, the half-lives of bioavailable POPs ranged from 1/3 to 1/20 of those of total POPs.
The ratio of the half-lives of bioavailable POPs to those of total POPs decreased in the order of HCHs > chlorinated cyclodienes > DDTs.
Because hydrophobic chemicals were adsorbed strongly to the soil, the bioavailable POPs in soil are controlled by their hydrophobicity, indicated by the values of log K (OW) (K (OW): n-octanol-water partition coefficient).
The shoot concentrations of chlorinated cyclodienes and DDTs were higher in [$cucurbits#Plant*] than in non-[$cucurbits#Plant*].
However, among POP insecticides, HCHs did not show clear differences.
As for the root concentrations, all tested POPs were higher in [$cucurbits#Plant*] than in non-[$cucurbits#Plant*].
Through the determination of POPs in soil solution, we could compare the abilities of plants to take up the chemicals using soil solution bioconcentration factors (BCFSS).
The values of BCFSS increased with the magnitude of log K (OW), in the order of HCHs < chlorinated cyclodienes < DDTs.
In addition, BCFSS did not show marked differences among isomers or chemicals with similar structure.
Therefore, plant uptake ability was influenced mainly by log K (OW).
After being applied to agricultural land, alpha- and gamma-HCHs seemed to disappear quickly, beta-HCH persisted longer but the uptake in roots was low because of the low log K (OW), and DDTs also persisted longer but the bioavailability decreased rapidly in the soil because of their high log K (OW).
Chlorinated cyclodienes have remained in the soil and have remained available, because they are less likely than HCHs (except beta-HCH) to disappear and less likely than DDTs to become adsorbed to the soil.
In addition, their higher log K (OW) than that of HCHs makes them more easily taken up by roots.
However, shoot concentrations were high only in [$cucurbits#Plant*], for which they remain a problem in Japan.
