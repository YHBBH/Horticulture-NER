Grafting is widely used in the commercial production of [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$Cucurbitaceae#Virus*]) and [$solanaceous #Plant*]([$Solanaceae#Plant*]) [$vegetables#Plant*], but seldom in the production of [$cruciferous#Plant*] [$vegetables#Plant*] such as [$cabbage#Plant*] ([@Brassica oleracea Capitata group#Plant*]).
In our study, we developed a tube grafting method for [$cabbage#Plant*] using the 'K-Y cross' [$cabbage#Plant*] as the scion and [@'Tsuei Jin' chinese kale#Plant*] ([@B.oleracea Alboglabra group#Plant*]) as the rootstock (K-Y/TJ), and then used the K-Y/TJ grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] to identify the best healing conditions.
The examined healing conditions included temperature (15, 20, or 25 degrees C), relative humidity (RH; 75%, 85%, or 95%), and light intensity (high light intensity, 79 to 107 mu mol.m(-2-s-1); low light intensity, 38.6 to 58.8 mu mol.m(-2.s-1); or full darkness, 0 mu mol.m(-2.s-1)).
Considering all the healing conditions, the K-Y/TJ grafted [$seedlings#Plant*] healing at 20 degrees C, 95% RH, and high light intensity exhibited survival rates of up to 96.7% and overall superior seedling quality.
'K-Y cross' [$cabbage#Plant*]s were then grafted onto chinese [$kale#Plant*] rootstocks, and the head traits of all grafted plants were comparable to those of nongrafted and/or self-grafted 'K-Y cross' plants.
'K-Y cross' plants grafted on 'Jie Lan' chinese [$kale#Plant*] rootstocks had greater ascorbic acid and total soluble solid (TSS) contents than nongrafted and self-grafted 'K-Y cross' plants.
Overall, this research describes a successful tube grafting method and the optimal healing conditions for grafted [$cabbage#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*], which can be used as a tool to improve head quality.
