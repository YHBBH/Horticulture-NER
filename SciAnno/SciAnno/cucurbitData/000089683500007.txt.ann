The Topnaar (formerly known as Hottentots) of the Namib Desert are still mostly hunter-gatherers.
They have learned to appreciate and utilize more than a hundred of the nearly 450 plant species occurring in their area of the desert.
Of these, 18 are either [@succulents#Plant*] or [$xerophytes#Plant*] belonging to ten families of angiosperms, with the [@Asclepiadaceae#Plant*] (with five species) being best represented.
The Topnaar's staple food is derived from the fruits of [$Acanthosicyos horridus#Plant*], a leafless [$cucurbit#Plant*] with green stems and fierce spines.
The paper summarizes the various uses of the 18 species studied during ethnobotanical field research in 1992.
