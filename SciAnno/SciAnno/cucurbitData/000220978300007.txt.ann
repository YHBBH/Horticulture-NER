This study was conducted to determine the host range of [@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] isolates from [$pumpkin#Plant*] and virulence of the isolates on [$pumpkin#Plant*] cultivars.
The [$pathogenicity#Plant*] of [@P.capsi#Virus*] isolates from [$pumpkin#Plant*] was evaluated on 45 species of [$herbaceous plants#Plant*], including 36 species of [$crops#Plant*] grown in rotation sequences with [$pumpkin#Plant*] and nine species of [$weeds#Plant*] that commonly grow in [$pumpkin#Plant*] fields in Illinois.
Plants were grown in the greenhouse, and 4-week-old [$seedlings#Plant*] were inoculated by adding 5 ml of a zoospore suspension (2 x 105 spores per ml of water) onto the soil surface around the stem of each plant in the pot.
Twenty-two [$crop#Plant*] species and two [$weed#Plant*] species became infected with P capsici and developed symptoms.
[@P capsici#Virus*] was reisolated all of the symptomatic plants [@by culturing tissues onto a semiselective medium#Method*] ([@PARP#Method*]).
Also, [$P capsici#Virus*] was detected in 87.5% of symptomatic plants by a [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) method [@using PCAP and IT5 primers#Method*].
[$Cucurbits#Plant*] and [$pepper#Plant*] were the most susceptible hosts of [$P capsici#Virus*].
Five [$crop#Plant*] species or varieties, [@beet#Plant*] ([@Beta vulgaris#Plant*]), [@Swiss-chard#Plant*] ([$Beta vulgaris#Plant*] var.cicla), [$lima beans#Plant*] ([@Phaseolus lunatus#Plant*]), [@turnip#Plant*] ([@Brassica rapa#Plant*]), and [$spinach#Plant*] ([@Spinacia oleracea#Plant*]), and one [$weed#Plant*] species, [@velvet-leaf#Plant*] ([@Abutilon theophrasti#Plant*]), were found to be hosts of [$P capsici#Virus*] for the first time.
Six isolates of [$P capsici#Virus*] were inoculated onto six [$pumpkin#Plant*] cultivars (three processing and three jack-o-lantern [$pumpkins#Plant*]) in the greenhouse and resulted in significant interactions between [$pathogen#Virus*] isolates and [$pumpkin#Plant*] types.
[@P.capsici#Virus*] isolates were more virulent on jack-o-lantern [$pumpkins#Plant*] than on processing [$pumpkins#Plant*].
