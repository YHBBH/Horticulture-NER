[@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]) causes serious damage in a large number of [$cucurbits#Plant*], and control measures are necessary.
Transgenic [$cucurbits#Plant*] expressing parts of the [$ZYMV#Virus*] genome have been shown to be resistant to the cognate virus.
A non-transgenic approach involving the exogenous application of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has also been shown to induce resistance in [$tobacco#Plant*] against [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]) and [$Tobacco mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$TMV#Virus*]).
In the present study, dsRNA molecules derived from the helper component-proteinase ([$HC-Pro#Gene*]) and [$coat protein#Gene*] ([$CP#Gene*]) genes of the [$ZYMV#Virus*]_DE_2014 isolate were produced in vitro.
On exogenous dsRNA application in [$cucumber#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$squash plant#Plant*]s, dsRNA HC-Pro conferred resistance of 82%, 50% and 18%, and dsRNA [$CP#Gene*] molecules of 70%, 43% and 16%, respectively.
On deep sequencing analysis of [$ZYMV#Virus*]-infected [$watermelon#Plant*], hot-spot regions for viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) in the genome of [$ZYMV#Virus*] were identified.
Stem-loop [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) detection of selected 21-nucleotide-long vsiRNAs in plants that received only dsRNA molecules suggested that the dsRNAs exogenously applied onto plants were successfully diced, thus initiating RNA silencing.
dsRNA molecules were found to be progressively degraded in planta, and strongly detected by semi-quantitative [$RT-PCR#Method*] for at least 9 days after exogenous application.
Moreover, dsRNA molecules were detected in systemic tissue of [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*], showing that dsRNA is transported long distances in these plants.
