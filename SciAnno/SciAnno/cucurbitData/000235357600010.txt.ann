[@Podosphaera fusca#Virus*] is the main causal agent of [@cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] in Spain and one of the most important limiting factors for [$cucurbit#Plant*] production worldwide.
As an obligate biotrophic parasite, this [$fungus#Virus*] has been traditionally cultured and conserved by periodical transfers of [$conidia#Virus*] to fresh plant material.
Here we describe a simple protocol for preservation of [@P.fusca#Virus*] isolates in absence of living tissue based on the dry spore, slow-freezing technique, and demonstrate that storage of silica gel desiccated [$conidia#Virus*] at -80 degrees C is an efficient method for the long-term preservation of the [$pathogen#Virus*].
