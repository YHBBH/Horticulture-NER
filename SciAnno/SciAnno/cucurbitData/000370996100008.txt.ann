The aphid-transmitted [@Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$MWMV#Virus*]; [$Potyvirus#Virus*], [$Potyviridae#Virus*]) is an emerging [$pathogen#Virus*] in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] in the Mediterranean basin but information on its transmitting vector species is limited.
This study aimed to record the competence of 22 species of the Greek aphid fauna to vector [$MWMV#Virus*].
Timed-probe transmission experiments and arena tests were performed using laboratory colonies of aphid species abundant in field [$surveys#Method*]; less common species were tested as apterous individuals collected directly from field plants in mass-inoculation (nonpersistent) tests.
Depending on the test, aphids were tested in cohorts of 10 or 20 individuals on [$zucchini#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]) plants and the frequency of transmission was calculated for a single aphid.
Among 12 species tested in timed-probe transmission tests, [@Myzus persicae nicotianae#Virus*] (74.0%) ap[$pea#Plant*]red to be the most efficient vector, followed by [@M.persicae#Virus*] (48.0%), [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*] (11.8%), an unidentified Aphis sp.(11.8%), and [@A.spiraecola#Virus*] (11.0%).
Alatae of nine species tested in arena tests transmitted the virus in rates varying from 0.7 to 53.6%; [$M.persicae#Virus*] was the most efficient species in virus spread.
In mass-inoculation tests, the probability that apterae of 12 [$aphid species#Virus*] collected from field plants transmitted [$MWMV#Virus*] fluctuated from 0.3 to 5.3%.
No transmission was obtained by [$Brevicoryne brassicae#Virus*].
The following species are reported as new vectors of [$MWMV#Virus*]: [@A.fabae#Virus*], [@A.nerii#Virus*], [@A.spiraephaga#Virus*], [@A.umbrella#Virus*], [@Capitophorus eleaegni#Virus*], [@Dysaphis (Pomaphis) pyri#Virus*], [$Macrosiphoniella sanborni#Virus*], [$Macrosiphum rosae#Virus*], [@Myzocallis castanicola#Virus*], [$Myzus persicae nicotianae#Virus*], [@M.cerasi#Virus*], [@M.varians#Virus*], [@Phorodon humuli#Virus*], [@Ovatus crataegarius#Virus*], [@Takecallis arundicolens#Virus*] (first report in Greece), [@Uroleucon sonchi#Virus*], and [@U.(Uromelan) aeneum#Virus*].
These results contribute to a better understanding of [$MWMV#Virus*] [$epidemiology#Method*].
