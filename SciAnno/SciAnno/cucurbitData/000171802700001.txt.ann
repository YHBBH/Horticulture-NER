[@Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp.malvae#Virus*], isolate Biomal(R), ATCC 20767, was originally isolated from round-leaved [$mallow#Virus*] ([$Malva pusilla#Virus*]) and developed as a [$weed#Plant*] biocontrol agent.
[@Ribosomal DNA sequence analysis#Method*] was recently used to re-classify this fungus as [$C.orbiculare#Virus*], which is an aggregate species with a number of formae speciales.
Several morphological features of ATCC 20767 were examined that were consistent with those described for [$C.orbiculare#Virus*], and inoculation of a number of [@Nicotiana#Plant*] species and several cultivars of [@N.tabacum#Plant*] showed that this fungus was [$pathogen#Virus*]ic to many of these previously undescribed hosts.
Spore germination and appressorium formation were higher on [$tobacco#Plant*] than previously observed on round-leaved [$mallow#Virus*].
The [$pathogen#Virus*] produced melanized appressoria on [$N.tabacum#Plant*] leaves that formed preferentially at the anticlinal epidermal cell wall.
A symptomless phase of infection persisted for 72-96 h postinoculation, during which time the fungus first produced a spherical infection vesicle from an infection peg, and then large primary hyphae which grew through the epidermal cells.
The large primary hyphae were highly constricted at the points of penetration of the host cell walls.
Thin secondary hyphae ap[$pea#Plant*]red at 96-120 h postinoculation coinciding with the ap[$pea#Plant*]rance of light green, water-soaked spots and the formation of acervuli.
The infection of [$tobacco#Plant*] by [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] ATCC 20767 is not a non-specific interaction but ap[$pears#Plant*] to follow an intracellular hemibiotrophic infection process that is very similar to that established for the [$C.orbiculare#Virus*] infection of round-leaved [$mallow#Virus*], [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$beans#Plant*].
