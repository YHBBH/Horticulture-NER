Wind-induced mechanical stress (MS) significantly increased the soluble peroxidase activity in leaves of [@cucumber#Plant*] over control levels after 9 days of treatment.
In comparison, inoculation with the fungal pathogen [$Cladosporium cucumerinum#Virus*] induced significant increases in peroxidase after 4 days.
[@Cucurbit anthracnose#Virus*] symptom development caused by [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*] was greater on leaves of [$seedlings#Plant*] exposed to 6 but not to 9 or 12 days of wind-induced MS than on leaves of control plants.
In contrast, reproduction of [$melon#Plant*] aphids was significantly reduced on leaves exposed to 12 days of MS relative to controls.
These results indicate that wind-induced MS can induce soluble peroxidase activity in [$cucumber#Plant*] and have divergent effects on the resistance to insects and [$pathogens#Virus*].
