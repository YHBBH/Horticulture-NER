The causal agent of [@cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] in southeastern Spain has been investigated since 1996.
Of the 139 single-spore isolates obtained, all were identified as [$Sphaerotheca fusca#Virus*].
Four physiological races (1, 2, 4 and 5) of the [$pathogen#Virus*] were detected.
During the survey, a population shift of [@S.fusca#Virus*] was observed: race I was progressively replaced by other races.
In addition, race coexistence was observed in several [$cucurbit#Plant*] greenhouses.
Four host range patterns or pathotypes were distinguished among the isolates of [$S.fusca#Virus*].
All isolates were highly aggressive on [$melon#Plant*] and especially on [$zucchini#Plant*] cultivars.
No clear relationships between races and pathotypes could be established, although isolates virulent on [$watermelon#Plant*] were preferentially associated with race 1.
These data show an apparent heterogeneity of [$S.fusca#Virus*] populations in southeastern Spain that should be analyzed further.
