[@Cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] ([@CPM#Disease*]), a disease on field and greenhouse [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide, is caused most frequently by two obligate erysiphaceous ectoparasites ([@Golovinomyces orontii s.l.#Plant*], [$Podosphaera xanthii#Plant*]) that are highly variable in their [$pathogenicity#Plant*] and virulence.
Various independent systems of [@CPM#Disease*] race determination and denomination are used worldwide, having to date been differentiated on different cultivars or lines of [$melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]).
We briefly review historical perspectives and the current state of understanding of the virulence variation of the two [@CPM#Disease*] [$pathogens#Virus*] at the [$pathogen#Virus*]ic race level, their differentiation and their designation.
Furthermore, we propose for use by the international [@CPM#Disease*] research, breeding, seed and production community new tools to enhance research, communication and management of [@CPM#Disease*].
These tools consist of five components: 1) a set of 21 differential genotypes of [$Cucumis melo L#Plant*].
for the identification of [@CPM#Disease*] races; 2) a triple-part, septet code for meaningful, concise designation of [@CPM#Disease*] races; 3) protocols for maintaining [@CPM#Disease*] isolates and differential genotypes and for laboratory assays to examine the virulence of [@CPM#Disease*] isolates; 4) rules and principles of practical application of this system in breeding, seed production and [$cucurbit #Plant*]growing, including a proposal of a race denomination suitable for practical application; and 5) crucial activities leading to the implementation and running of new tools for [@CPM#Disease*] research and management.
The five components of this package have equal importance, forming a compact system, and none of them can be omitted.
