[@Bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*] Standl.) has been commonly used as a source of rootstock for [$watermelon#Plant*].
To improve its performance as a rootstock without adverse effects on the scion, the [$bottle gourd#Plant*] was genetically engineered using a modified [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] Ca2+/H+ exchanger sCAX2B.
This transporter provides enhanced Ca2+ substrate specificity and decreased Mn2+ transport capability.
Our previous work demonstrated that sCAX2B [$bottle gourd#Plant*]s were more robust and nutrient dense than controls.
Here, several [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] were test-grafted onto the transgenic [$bottle gourd#Plant*] to determine its effect on the scions.
The grafted [$watermelons#Plant*] and [$melons#Plant*] onto the transgenic rootstocks appeared to show more robust growth than the controls 35 days after greenhouse transplanting.
[$Watermelon#Plant*] fruits with the [$watermelon#Plant*]/transgenic [$bottle gourd#Plant*] (scion/rootstock) combination demonstrated higher osmotic pressure and more soluble solids than controls.
These results suggest that sCAX2B expression in the [$bottle gourd#Plant*] rootstock facilitates improved [$watermelon#Plant*] quality through the translocation of nutrients and/or water toward enhancing the biomass of scion.
