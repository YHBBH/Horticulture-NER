[@Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*] and [$Golovinomyces orontii#Virus*] are the causal agents of [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*].
The effect of temperature on [$conidia#Virus*]l germination, infection and sporulation was studied under controlled conditions.
Conidia were inoculated on [$cucumber#Plant*] leaf discs, and incubated at six constant temperatures (from 10 to 35 degrees C in 5 degrees C steps) for 3 to 72 h to evaluate [$conidia#Virus*]l germination and infection, and for 6-15 days to evaluate sporulation intensity.
Germination took place at all tested temperatures, but was close to zero at 35 degrees C.
The longest germ tubes measured in this experiment were 141.74 mu m for the secondary germ tube of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] at 20 degrees C after 48 h of incubation, and 67.92 mu m for [$G.orontii#Virus*] for the primary germ tube at 20 degrees C after 48 h of incubation.
The optimal temperatures for [$conidia#Virus*]l germination, infection and sporulation were 24.4, 25.7 and 22.3 degrees C, respectively, for [@P.xanthii#Virus*], and 17.9, 17.3 and 14.9 degrees C, respectively, for [$G.orontii#Virus*].
Equations were developed to describe [$conidia#Virus*]l germination with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85 and 0.90 for [@P.xanthii#Virus*] and [$G.orontii#Virus*], respectively.
Infection equations resulted in R-2 of 0.94 and 0.93 for [@P.xanthii#Virus*] and [$G.orontii#Virus*], respectively; and for sporulation, R-2 of 0.75 and 0.76 for [@P.xanthii#Virus*] and [$G.orontii#Virus*] respectively, as a function of temperature.
These results can be used to develop models for the risk of [@cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] under field conditions.
