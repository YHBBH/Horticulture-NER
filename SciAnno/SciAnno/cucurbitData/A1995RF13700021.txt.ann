In a survey of [@cucurbit crops#Plant*] in Sudan, 234 samples of [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]showing symptoms of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] were [$infe#Plant*]cted with [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*], while [$Erysiphe cichoracearum#Virus*] was only observed on two samples of [$watermelon#Plant*] showing mild symptoms, [$Leveillula taurica#Virus*] was not observed on any sample.
Field trials with differential lines of [$melon#Plant*] revealed the presence of race 1 of [$S.fuliginea#Virus*] in Gezira (Central Sudan) in the summer of 1993, and race 2 in the following winter.
Virulence tests in controlled conditions on a limited number of isolates suggest that a shift in prevalence of those races may have occurred on that site over time.
The geographic scale of this shift was probably limited as race 0 was observed in late autumn in northeast Sudan in the Gash Delta.
