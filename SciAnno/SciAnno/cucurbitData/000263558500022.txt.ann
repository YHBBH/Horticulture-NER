In recent years there has been an effort towards the development of genomic resources in several [@cucurbit species#Plant*], mainly in [$melon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*].
The number of available sequences for these species in public databases has increased recently.
This has allowed the design of microarrays for transcriptome analysis and the discovery of [@SNP markers#Method*] for genotyping.
Other genomic tools are also available in [$melon#Plant*] as [@BAC libraries#Method*], mutant populations and saturated genetic maps.
Some international initiatives have emerged that will probably lead to the sequencing of the complete genomes of some [$cucurbit species#Plant*] during the next years.
