A study was conducted to better understand the population structure of [@Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), a severe virus affecting [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide, in Tunisia and to estimate whether the use of resistant cultivars may provide durable control.
Analysis of the polymerase and [$coat protein#Gene*] (NIb-[$CP#Gene*]) partial sequences of 83 isolates collected in the three main [$cucurbit#Plant*]-growing areas in Tunisia showed that [$ZYMV#Virus*] grouped into two distinct clusters within [$ZYMV#Virus*] molecular group A.
An important variability was observed in the MREK motif of the [@P3 protein#Gene*], a motif associated with tolerance breaking in [$ZYMV#Virus*]-tolerant [$zucchini squash#Plant*] cultivars.
Interestingly, significant differences were found in the distribution of the MREK variants in the two clusters defined by the partial NIb-[$CP#Gene*] sequences, MREK and MKEK sequences being more common in cluster 1 and cluster 2, respectively.
When combining NIb-[$CP#Gene*] and [@P3#Gene*] sequence information, [$ZYMV#Virus*] molecular variability was shown to be significantly higher in the Cap Bon region than in the Bizerte area.
An important biological variability was observed in a subset of 23 isolates regarding symp[$tomato#Plant*]logy in susceptible or resistant [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Some isolates overcame [$ZYMV#Virus*] tolerance or resistance in [$zucchini squash#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*], but not in [$cucumber#Plant*].
Three serotypes were differentiated using a set of 13 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).
Seven parameters characterizing the 23 isolates, including molecular, serological and biological properties, were used for a [@multiple component analysis (MCA)#Method*].
This analysis revealed that symptom intensity of a given isolate was similar in different susceptible [$cucurbit#Plant*] hosts, suggesting similar degrees of aggressiveness in different hosts.
