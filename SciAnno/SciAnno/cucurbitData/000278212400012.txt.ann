Premise of the study: Floral nectars of many species contain antimicrobial chemicals, but their function in nectar is subject to debate.
Previously, we have shown that [@Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*], the causative agent of [@bacterial wilt disease#Disease*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*], can be transmitted via the floral nectaries.
   Methods: We used a [@disk diffusion assay (DDA)#Method*] to determine the antimicrobial effects of nectar from a wild [$gourd#Plant*] on lawns of [@Escherichia coli#Virus*] and [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*].
We also used [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] to inoculate flowers of wild [$gourd#Plant*] plants, with and without nectar.
   Key results: The DDA showed that paper disks saturated with 10 mu L of nectar inhibited the growth of [@E.coli#Virus*] on a larger area of the lawn than 40% glucose but a smaller area than 5% ampicillin for 12 h.
On lawns of [$E.tracheiphila#Plant*], nectar inhibited growth on a larger area than glucose for 24 h and there were no significant differences between ampicillin and nectar for 12 h.
A significantly larger proportion of the plants inoculated via flowers without nectar contracted wilt disease than plants with nectar.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that nectar reduces transmission of [@E.tracheiphila#Virus*] via the nectaries and reveal the potential for florally transmitted [$pathogens#Virus*] to influence the evolution of floral traits.
