[@Bud necrosis disease#Disease*] is an emerging threat for [$watermelon#Plant*] cultivation in India.
It is characterized by necrotic spots and patches on leaves, bud and fruits with characteristic chlorotic ring spots as documented in Coimbatore and Villupuram districts of Tamil Nadu, India.
The causative agent of this disease was identified as [@watermelon bud necrosis virus#Virus*] ([$WBNV#Virus*]) by [$reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) followed by [$sequence analysis#Method*] of amplified fragment using Ortho[$tospovirus#Virus*] universal degenerate primer pair.
Upon [$mechanical inoculation#Method*], the virus produced circular chlorotic local lesions on leaves of [$cowpea#Plant*] and [$Chenopodium amaranticolor#Plant*], necrotic local lesions on Trianthema portulacastrum and [$bottle gourd#Plant*], systemic vein clearing on [$Luffa aegyptiaca#Plant*], whereas both local and systemic symptoms were observed on [$Nicotiana tabacum#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*].
The complete nucleotide sequences of the [$coat protein#Gene*] (NP), movement protein (MP), replicase (RdRp) and [@NSs protein genes#Gene*] from [$WBNV#Virus*] genome of Coimbatore isolate (TN KTP WM1) had a maximum identity of 97% with the genome of the [$WBNV#Virus*]-JT strain from Southern India.
[$WBNV#Virus*] infection causes significant reduction in nutritional parameters such as carbohydrate, protein, crude fibre, calorific value, total sugar, reducing sugar and vitamin A in infected fruits when compared to the healthy ones.
For the management of [$WBNV#Virus*] in [$watermelon#Plant*], an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) module has been devised which reduced the thrips population and [$WBNV#Virus*] incidence to a great extent besides increasing the fruit yield.
