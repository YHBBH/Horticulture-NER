In the past two decades, viruses in the genera [$Crinivirus#Virus*] and [@Begomovirus#Virus*], transmitted by [$whiteflies#Virus*], have emerged as threatening diseases to [$cucurbit #Plant*]cultivation.
The criniviruses [$Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CCYV#Virus*]) and [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) occur in mixed infection at high rates in [$cucumber#Plant*] greenhouses in Lebanon.
The [$begomovirus#Virus*] [$Squash leaf curl virus#Plant*] ([$SLCV#Virus*]) is also present in the country infecting [$cucumber#Plant*] but at a lower incidence.
The effect of single, dual or triple virus infections on [$cucumber#Plant*] was studied.
Single infection by [$SLCV#Virus*] did not lead to any symptoms or yield reduction.
[$CYSDV#Virus*] or [$CCYV#Virus*] infections led to development of characteristic yellowing symptoms.
In single infections, [$CYSDV#Virus*] caused the greatest reductions in height and yield that ranged from 25 to 62 % and 52 to 63 %, respectively, depending on season and variety.
[$CCYV#Virus*] induced less severe reduction in height, 10 to 33 %, and in fruit number, 10 to 12 %.
Yellowing symptoms induced by dual infections in any combination were similar to those of singly-infected plants.
Triple infections resulted in substantial reductions in plant height and yield as compared to single or dual infections.
This is the first report that characterizes a significant increase in disease severity upon co-infection between [$cucurbit#Virus*]-infecting criniviruses and [$begomoviruses#Virus*].
The implications of these observations on integrated disease management strategies are discussed.
