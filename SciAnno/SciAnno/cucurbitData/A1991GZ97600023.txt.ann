 [@Cucurbits#Plant*] are important [$crops#Plant*] for both staple and dessert foods.
Past reviews have not covered insect resistance in [$cucurbits#Plant*] thoroughly, especially since much work has been done recently.
Screening methods make a large difference in the efficiency of selection for resistance to insects.
Resistance of cultigens should be evaluated using several biotypes of each insect being evaluated, and efficient test conditions with good control of environment.
If possible, laboratory tests should be used to improve the repeatability and to reduce experimental error.
Resistance to insects has been identified in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
For example, [$muskmelons#Plant*] have been identified that have resistance to [$melon aphid#Virus*] and red [$pumpkin#Plant*] beetle.
On the other hand, resistance to pickleworm has not been identified after screening hundreds of [$cucumber#Plant*] cultigens.
Conclusions drawn on the role of [$cucurbit#Virus*]acins in insect resistance to [$cucurbits#Plant*] are not unanimous.
Studies on the genetic control of resistance in [$cucurbits#Plant*] indicate that there are at least 13 [$crop#Plant*]-insect cases where there is heritable resistance.
With greater emphasis in [$cucurbit #Plant*]breeding programmes, multiple insect resistance should be obtainable in many of the [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
