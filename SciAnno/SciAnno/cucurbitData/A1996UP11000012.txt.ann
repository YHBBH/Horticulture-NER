[@Tomato infectious chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$TICV#Virus*]) is a newly described closterovirus.
Virions purified from [$TICV#Virus*]-infected plants contained two single-stranded (ss) RNAs, one of approximately 7,800 (RNA 1) and the other 7,400 (RNA 2) nucleotides.
Double-stranded (ds) RNA analysis showed two prominent dsRNAs of approximately 7,800 and 7,400 bp, as well as several smaller dsRNAs.
The [$TICV#Virus*] virion ssRNAs were used for cDNA cloning.
Of 200 cDNA clones analyzed, 10 clones containing cDNAs ranging in size from about 900 to 1,500 nucleotides were used to generate digoxigenin-UTP-labeled transcripts.
These transcripts hybridized with the [$TICV#Virus*] ssRNAs in [@Northern blot hybridization analyses#Method*] and were used in [@dot-blot analyses#Method*] to confirm [$TICV#Virus*] infection in several [$host plants#Plant*] including [$tomato#Plant*], [$potato#Plant*], [$Physalis wrightii#Plant*], [@Nicotiana clevelandii#Plant*], and [$artichoke#Plant*].
None of the probes reacted with any uninfected host plant tested or with plants [$infe#Plant*]cted with four other clostero- or clostero-like viruses including [$lettuce infectious yellows closterovirus#Virus*], [$lettuce chlorosis virus#Virus*], [$cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*], and [@beet pseudo yellows virus#Virus*].
[$Northern blot hybridization analyses#Method*] using selected riboprobes showed no detectable homology between [$TICV#Virus*] dsRNA 1 and 2, or between subsets of smaller dsRNAs.
Inclusion bodies, characteristic of the closteroviruses, were consistently associated with the phloem of [$TICV#Virus*]-infected N.clevelandii.
