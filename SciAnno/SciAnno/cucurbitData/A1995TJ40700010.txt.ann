 Malathion bait sprays were applied to border rows of [@sweet corn#Plant*] ([@Zea maize L.#Plant*]) planted adjacent to [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbit #Plant*]fields in Kauai, Hawaii.
The sprays were used to control the tephritid fruit flies, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) and B.
[$cucurbitae#Plant*] ([$Coquillett#Virus*]), that oviposit into [$papaya#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] but spend much of their time roosting on adjacent border vegetation.
Sweep-net samples in both treated and untreated [$corn#Plant*] plantings showed that significant reductions in overall species richness and species diversity occurred in malathion-bait treated [$corn#Plant*].
Numbers of beneficial insects (predators and parasitoids) were also reduced in treated [$corn#Plant*], although this reduction may have resulted from prey depletion as well as direct mortality.
Endemic insects were not well represented in the samples, and do not appear to be at risk from [$corn#Plant*] border spraying in western Kauai.
