To test the contribution of [@pectate lyase#Gene*] ([@PL#Gene*]) to promoting fungal pathogenicity, a [@pectate lyase gene#Gene*] ([@pel#Gene*]) from the [@avocado pathogen#Virus*] [$Colletotrichum gloeosporioides#Virus*], isolate Cg-14, was expressed in [@C. magna#Virus*] isolate L-2.5, a [$pathogen#Virus*] of [$cucurbits#Plant*] that causes minor symptoms in [$watermelon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] and [@avocado#Plant*] fruits.
Isolate L-2.5 was transformed with pPCPH-1 containing [@hph-B#Gene*] as a selectable marker and the 4.1-kb genomic [$pel#Gene*] clone, [@Southern hybridization#Method*], with the 4.1-kb genomic [$pel#Gene*] clone or 2.13-kb [$hph-B#Gene*] cassette as probes, detected integration of [$pel#Gene*] in transformed [$C. magna#Virus*] isolates Cm-PL-3 and Cm-PL-10.
[@Western blot (immunoblot) analysis#Method*] with antibodies against Cg-14 PL detected a single pi, secreted by L-2.5 at a molecular mass of 41.5 kDa, whereas the [$PL#Gene*] of [@C. gloeosporioides#Virus*] had a molecular mass of 39 kDa.
When pi, activity was measured 4 days after inoculation in pectolytic enzyme-inducing media (PEIM), transformed isolates Cm-[$PL#Gene*]-3 and Cm-[$PL#Gene*]-10 showed additive [$PL#Gene*] activity relative to both Cg-14 and L-2.5.
Transformed isolates also showed additive [$mace#Plant*]ration capabilities on [$avocado#Plant*] pericarp relative to the wild-type [$C. magna#Virus*] alone, but did not reach the [$mace#Plant*]ration ability of [$C. gloeosporioides#Virus*], However, more severe [$mace#Plant*]ration and [$damping off#Disease*] developed in [$watermelon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] inoculated with the transformed isolates compared with the two wild-type isolates, which showed no symptom development on these [$seedlings#Plant*] during the same period.
Results clearly show the contribution of a single [$pel#Gene*] to the [$pathogen#Virus*]ic abilities of [$C. magna#Virus*] and suggest that [$PL#Gene*], is a [$pathogenicity#Method*] factor required for the penetration and colonization of [@Colletotrichum#Virus*] species.
