Biotechnological methods utilized in [@Cucumis#Plant*] research - A review.
Hort.

(Prague), 38: 150-158.
   Our biotechnological research on selected [$Cucumis#Plant*] species has encompassed interspecific hybridization via embryo-rescue, in vitro pollination, somatic hybridization and cytogenetics of protoplasts.
Embryo-rescue and in vitro pollination are suitable in vitro techniques for production of hybrid embryos.
These methods were tested and optimized for [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Protoplast culture is another valuable tool for biotechnological applications, such as somatic hybridization and [$genetic transformation#Method*].
We study protoplast dedifferentiation not only as a biotechnological application in breeding systems, but mainly to describe mechanisms of obtaining totipotency.
Protoplasts of [$cucurbits#Plant*] were studied cytogenetically to observe changes in nuclear architecture during protoplastization and regeneration and for comparison with the expression profile obtained using [@cDNA-AFLP techniques and reverse transcription for the specific genes involved#Method*].
