During the spring season of 2014, a total of 148 [$melon#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] leaf samples were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic plants in the western and southwestern regions of Saudi Arabia and were tested for the presence of [$Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus#Virus*] ([$WmCSV#Virus*]) and other suspected [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]by double antibody sandwich [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*]s.
Ninety-eight samples were found to be positive for the presence of VVmCSV, nine samples were positive for the presence of [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), and 22 showed a mixed infection with both [$WmCSV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*].
No other [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]were detected in any of the samples.
Host range experiments revealed that eight out of fourteen tested plant species were susceptible to [$WmCSV#Virus*].
[$PCR#Method*] products of approximately 1.2 kb were obtained after amplification using primers specifically targeting the [$coat protein#Gene*] region of [$WmCSV#Virus*].
Positive [$PCR#Method*] results were confirmed by dot blot hybridization.
[$Coat protein#Gene*] gene sequences from eleven [$WmCSV#Virus*] isolates indicated that the highest identity was between the 104WMA-SA isolate from the Wadi Baish location and a previously reported isolate from the AL-Lith location in Saudi Arabia.
The lowest identity was observed between the 42WMA-SA isolate and an isolate from Palestine.
