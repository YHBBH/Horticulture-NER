[@Winter squash#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita maxima Duchense#Plant*]) and [$pumpkins#Plant*] ([@Cucurbita moschata Duchense#Plant*]) are one of the most important [$Cucurbit#Plant*] [$vegetable crops#Plant*] in Turkey.
This study was carried out in the Black Sea region of Turkey between 2005 and 2008 years.
The objective was to develop new [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata Duchense#Plant*]) cultivar candidates.
In the first year, 22 [$pumpkin#Plant*] populations were collected from different ecogeographical areas in this region.
Two [$pumpkin#Plant*] accessions were obtained from the [$pumpkin#Plant*] collection preserved at the Turkish seed genebank (AARI).
All genotypes were examined with respect to morphological characteristics.
In addition, physical, chemical and sensual analyses were carried out for the [$pumpkin#Plant*] being used as a dessert.
From the observations, 4 types were evaluated as superior using a weighting based ranking method.
At the end of this research, 1 genotype (14BO01) was selected as being promising for further breeding efforts.
