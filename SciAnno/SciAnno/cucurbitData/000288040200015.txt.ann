For quarantine purpose, we selected five plant RNA viruses including [@Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]), [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), [@Potato aucuba mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@PAMV#Virus*]), [@Potato yellow dwarf virus#Virus*] ([@PYDV#Virus*]), and [$Tomato chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$ToCV#Virus*]), which are not reported in Korea and cause serious economic losses to the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] or [$Solanaceae#Plant*].
To detect those viruses, we employed [@RT-PCR technique#Method*] with specific oligonucleotide primer pairs and tested their detection efficiency for each virus.
To design [$RT-PCR#Method*] primers, [$coat protein#Gene*] was used for [$CVYV#Virus*], [$CYSDV#Virus*], and [$ToCV#Virus*] whereas RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid regions were used for [$PAMV#Virus*] and [$PYDV#Virus*], respectively.
The development of an [$RT-PCR#Method*] based method proved a useful tool for rapid detection and identification of quarantine virus infections.
