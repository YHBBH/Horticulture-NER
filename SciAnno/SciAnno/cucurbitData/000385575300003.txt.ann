[@Chayote#Plant*] ([@Sicyos edulis#Plant*]) has been identified, based on the concentrations of genetic diversity, as a cultigen native to southern Mexico and Guatemala.
However, a pan-etymological analysis from a Mesoamerican perspective with evidence available in ethnographic data concludes that Guatemala was not the place of origin.
It is more likely that [$chayote#Plant*] was first cultivated or identified in the 12th century BCE by Otomanguean speakers in Southern Mexico.
Moreover, archaeological evidence supports that the Maya cultivated [$chayote#Plant*] as early as the eighth century CE.
[$Chayote#Plant*] was not an important economic [$crop#Plant*], nor an elite item, but it bore an important role among the nonelite.
Metaphorically, [$chayote#Plant*] is related to the feminine, it is the life container, and its hairy cleft the vulva; paired off with its opposite, the chili [$pepper#Plant*] ([$Capsicum#Plant*]), it becomes the a priori symbol of sexual union.
The "[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] tree" an old designation for [$chayote#Plant*] is present in ancient Yucatec art represented as [$Cucurbit#Plant*] [$vines#Plant*], a synecdoche for the First World Tree.
Linguistic analysis concludes that in general, local indigenous people classified the [$chayote#Plant*] as a [$cucurbit#Virus*], organizing its subtypes according to color and presence of thorns.
