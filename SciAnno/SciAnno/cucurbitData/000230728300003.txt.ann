[@Begomoviruses#Virus*] were detected in Nicaraguan fields of [$tomato#Plant*] ([$Lycopersicon esculentum#Plant*]) and adjacently growing plants of [$pepper#Plant*] ([$Capsicum annuum#Plant*]), [@chilli pepper#Plant*] ([@C.baccatum#Plant*]), [@cushaw#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita argyrosperma#Plant*]) and [@Mexican fireplant#Plant*] ([@Euphorbia heterophylla#Plant*]) using [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*]) and [@universal begomovirus primers#Method*].
All [$tomato#Plant*] and [$Mexican fireplant#Plant*] plants showing symptoms were infected with [@begomoviruses#Virus*], while only 30-46% of the [$pepper#Plant*], [$chilli pepper#Plant*] and [$cushaw#Plant*] plants showing symptoms tested virus-positive.
No [$begomoviruses#Virus*] were found in [$potato#Plant*].
The virus species were provisionally identified by sequencing 533 bp of the viral [@coat protein gene#Gene*] (AV1).
[@Tomato severe leaf curl virus#Virus*] ([@ToSLCV#Virus*]), [@Tomato leaf curl Sinaloa virus#Virus*] ([@ToLCSinV#Virus*]) and [@Pepper golden mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@PepGMV#Virus*]) were found to infect both [$tomato#Plant*] and [$pepper#Plant*].
A new provisional species designated [@Tomato leaf curl Las Playitas virus#Virus*] ([@ToLCLPV#Virus*]) was detected in a [$tomato#Plant*] plant.
[@Squash yellow mottle virus#Virus*] ([@SYMoV#Virus*]) and [$PepGMV#Virus*] were found in [$cucurbits#Plant*], the latter for the first time in this host.
[@Euphorbia mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@EuMV#Virus*) was detected in [$Mexican fireplant#Plant*].
Sequencing of a larger number of [$PCR#Method*]-amplified clones from selected plants revealed intraspecific viral sequence variability, and also multiple [$begomovirus#Virus*] infections which could represent up to three species in a single [$tomato#Plant*] or [$cushaw#Plant*] plant.
Phylogenetic grouping of virus sequences did not correlate with the host of origin.
