[@UV treatments #Method*]of plug transplants of [@muskmelon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*] were performed in greenhouse to control [$seedlings#Plant*] height and improve their adaptation to outdoor conditions.
UV-B sources, Philips TL12-40W were placed 0.5 m -2 above the [$seedlings#Plant*].
[$UV treatments #Method*]were re[$pea#Plant*]ted daily, 0.5-2 h/day (4.3-25.8 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) in the middle of the night, for one week and started when cotyledons emerged from the soil.
The [$UV treatments #Method*]were compared to the untreated and paclobutrazol (PCB) sprayed (0.7ml/l) controls.
Plant height, leaf area and stem and leaf dry weights were significantly lowered by [$UV treatments #Method*]in all species investigated.
[$Cucumber#Plant*] was the most and [$watermelon#Plant*] the least sensitive to the UV treatments.
