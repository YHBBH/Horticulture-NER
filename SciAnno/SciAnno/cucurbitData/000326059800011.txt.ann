The genetic variability of a [@Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]) ([$genus Polerovirus#Virus*], [@family Luteoviridae#Virus*]) population was evaluated by determining the nucleotide sequences of two genomic regions of [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates collected in open-field [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*][$crops#Plant*] during three consecutive years in Murcia (southeastern Spain).
A [$phylogenetic analysis#Method*] showed the existence of two major clades.
The sequences did not cluster according to host, year, or locality of collection, and nucleotide similarities among isolates were 97 to 100 and 94 to 97% within and between clades, respectively.
The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions reflected that all open reading frames have been under purifying selection.
Estimates of the population's genetic diversity were of the same magnitude as those previously reported for other plant virus populations sampled at larger spatial and temporal scales, suggesting either the presence of [$CABYV#Virus*] in the surveyed area long before it was first described, multiple introductions, or a particularly rapid diversification.
We also determined the full-length sequences of three isolates, identifying the occurrence and location of recombination events along the [$CABYV#Virus*] genome.
Furthermore, our field [$surveys#Method*] indicated that [$Aphis gossypii#Virus*] was the major vector species of [$CABYV#Virus*] and the most abundant [$aphid species#Virus*] colonizing [$melon#Plant*] fields in the Murcia (Spain) region.
Our [$surveys#Method*] also suggested the importance of the [$weed#Plant*] species [$Ecballium elaterium#Plant*] as an alternative host and potential virus reservoir.
