[@Cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] ([@CDM#Disease*]), caused by the oomycete [$pathogen#Virus*] [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Plant*], is a devastating disease that affects [$cucurbit species #Plant*]worldwide.
This obligate, wind-dispersed [$pathogen#Virus*] does not overwinter in Michigan or other northern regions and new isolates can enter the state throughout the growing season.
To evaluate the regional and temporal population structure of [$P.cubensis#Virus*], sporangia from [$CDM#Disease*] le[$sions#Plant*] were collected from [$cucurbit #Plant*]foliage grown in Michigan and Ontario field locations in 2011.
Population structure and genetic diversity were assessed in 257 isolates using nine simple sequence repeat markers.
Genetic diversity was high for isolates from Michigan and Canada (0.6627 and 0.6131, respectively).
Five genetic clusters were detected and changes in population structure varied by site and sampling date within a growing season.
The Michigan and Canada populations were significantly differentiated, and a unique genetic cluster was detected in Michigan.
