Our objectives were to screen [@melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) breeding lines and cultivars for resistance to [$cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) in four different environments, detect virus from dsRNA extracts of infected leaves of lines and cultivars using [$RT-PCR#Method*] with the previously developed specific primer pair for [$CYSDV#Virus*], and identify [$RAPD markers#Method*] associated with QTL for resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*] in two F-2 [$melon#Plant*] populations under natural and controlled-inoculation conditions.
Regardless of environments, TGR1551 consistently showed slight yellowing symptoms on lower leaves, whereas it showed no disease symptoms on upper leaves.
A [$PCR#Method*] product was obtained from the lower leaves of TGR1551, but no [$PCR#Method*] product was produced from the upper leaves, indicating its moderate resistance to [$CYSDV#Virus*].
Continuous frequency distributions for reactions to [$CYSDV#Virus*] were observed in the two F2 populations in natural and controlled-inoculation conditions indicating quantitative inheritance of the reactions to [$CYSDV#Virus*].
Eight [$RAPD markers#Method*] were found to be significantly associated with QTL for [$CYSDV#Virus*] resistance in natural and controlled-inoculation conditions based on simple linear regression.
Significant associations of markers OOM15.600 and OAU03.700 from TGR1551 with [$CYSDV#Virus*] resistance were consistently expressed in our populations under natural and controlled-inoculation conditions, and accounted for 7% and 25% of the phenotypic variation.
These markers linked to QTL for [$CYSDV#Virus*] resistance could be utilized in the development of resistant cultivars or breeding lines.
