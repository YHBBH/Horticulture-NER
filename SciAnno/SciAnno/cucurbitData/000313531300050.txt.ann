[@Powdery mildew#Disease*] ([@Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*]) affects [$seedlings#Plant*] of inter-specific hybrid [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] x[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima) and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] ([$Lagenaria siceraria#Plant*]) used as [$rootstocks#Plant*] to graft seedless [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]).
Because[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] grows primarily on the leaf surface where contact fungicides are effective, biofungicides may be effective preventative treatments for[$ powdery mildew#Virus*].
The objectives of this study were to determine which biofungicides, organic fungicides, and conventional synthetic fungicides provided the best control of[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] and least phytotoxicity on [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstock [$seedlings#Plant*] in the greenhouse.
Sixteen treatments (six biopesticides, four additional organic-approved fungicides, and six conventional synthetic fungicides) were tested.
Four experiments were conducted and all were repeated once.
Hybrid [$squash #Plant*]'Strong Tosa' [$seedlings#Plant*] were used in the first three experiments, and [$bottle gourd#Plant*] 'Emphasis' [$seedlings#Plant*] were used in experiment four.
In experiments one, two, and four, [$seedlings#Plant*] were sprayed three times at 5-day intervals and exposed to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] continuously after the first application.
In the third experiment, [$seedlings#Plant*] were exposed to inoculum for 7 days, sprayed once, and held in a humidity chamber for 7 days under conditions used for healing after grafting.
The most effective organic-approved fungicides were sulfur and fish oil + sesame oil, and the most effective conventional fungicides were penthiopyrad, myclobutanil, and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil.
Quinoxyfen was phytotoxic to cotyledons of both species, and tebuconazole stunted both species.
To manage[$ powdery mildew#Virus*], one or two preventative applications of sulfur or fish oil + sesame oil and one application of myclobutanil or penthiopyrad, if needed, are recommended.
