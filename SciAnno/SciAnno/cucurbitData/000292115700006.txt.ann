The most economically important plant pathogens in the [@genus Pseudoperonospora#Virus*] ([@family Peronosporaceae#Virus*]) are [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] and [@P humuli#Virus*], causal agents of [$downy mildew#Virus*] on [$cucurbits#Plant*] and hop, respectively.
Recently, [@P.humuli#Virus*] was reduced to a taxonomic synonym of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence data and morphological characteristics.
Nomenclature has many practical implications for [$pathogen#Virus*] identification and regulatory considerations; therefore, further clarification of the genetic and [$pathogen#Virus*]ic relatedness of these organisms is needed.
[$Phylogenetic analyses#Method*] were conducted considering two nuclear and three mitochondrial loci for 21 isolates of [$P cubensis#Virus*] and 14 isolates of [$P humuli#Virus*], and all published ITS sequences of the [$pathogens#Virus*] in GenBank.
There was a consistent separation of the majority of the P hunudi isolates and the [$P cubensis#Virus*] isolates in nuclear, mitochondrial, and [$ITS phylogenetic analyses#Method*], with the exception of isolates of [$P.humuli#Virus*] from Hainalus japonicas from Korea.
The [$P cubensis#Virus*] isolates appeared to contain the [$P humuli#Virus*] cluster, which may indicate that [$P.humuli#Virus*] descended from [$P cubensis#Virus*].
Host-specificity experiments were conducted with two reportedly universally susceptible hosts of [$P cubensis#Virus*] and two hop cultivars highly susceptible to [$P cubensis#Virus*] consistently infected the hop cultivars at very low rates, and sporangiophores invariably emerged from necrotic or chlorotic hypersensitive-like le[$sions#Plant*].
Only a single sporangiophore of [$P humuli#Virus*] was observed on a [$cucurbit #Plant*]plant during the course of the studies.
Together, molecular data and host specificity indicate that there are biologically relevant characteristics that differentiate [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and [$P humuli#Virus*] that may be obfuscated if [$P humuli#Virus*] were reduced to a taxonomic synonym of [$P.cubensis#Virus*].
Thus, we recommend retaining the two species names [$P.cubensis #Virus*]and [$P humuli#Virus*] until the species boundaries can be resolved unambiguously.
