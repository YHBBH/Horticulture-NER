 Under controlled inoculation, a set of 56 accessions belonging to 19 wild species of the [$genus Cucumis#Plant*] was studied for resistance to seven isolates of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] ([@Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk.et Curt.) Rostow.#Virus*]) from [$cucumber#Plant*].
 No resistance to [$P.cubensis #Virus*]was detected in these [$Cucumis#Plant*] accessions.
 In three host accession/[$pathogen#Virus*] isolate combinations, limited sporulation was observed.
 Nine new [$Cucumis#Plant*] species are described as hosts for [$P.cubensis#Virus*]:  [@C.africanus#Plant*], [$C.ficifolius#Plant*], [@C.figarei#Plant*], [@C.meeusii#Plant*], [$C.metuliferus#Plant*], [@C.myriocarpus#Plant*], [@C.leptodermis#Plant*], [$C.sagittatus#Plant*] and [@C.zeyheri#Plant*].
 Results are discussed in relation to the origin and evolution of [$Cucumis#Plant*] species.
