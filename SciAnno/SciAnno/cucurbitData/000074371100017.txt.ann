Two [@whitefly#Virus*]-transmitted viruses elicit identical symptoms of intreveinal chlorosis (yellowing) in greenhouse- and field-grown [@cucurbits#Plant*] in Mediterranean countries.
The agents of these diseases are partially characterized closteorviruses and are known as [$beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]), which is transmitted by [$Trialeurodes vaporariorum#Virus*], and [$cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), transmitted by [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*].
Using previously determined sequence information for fragments of the [@HSP70#Gene*] homolog genes of both [$BPYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*], oligonucleotide primers were designed for [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) protocols to differentiate between the two viruses.
[$RT-PCR#Method*] amplified products for each virus were subsequently cloned and specifically hybridized with the homologous dsRNA (approximately 9 kbp in size for both viruses) following [$Northern hybridization analysis#Method*].
Minor dsRNAs of approximately 5 kbp for both viruses and one dsRNA of 3 kbp for [$CYSDV#Virus*] were also identified by [$Northern hybridization#Method*] and might represent defective RNA species.
In order to compare the predicted amino acid sequence of fragments of the [$HSP70#Gene*] homolog genes of [$BPYV#Virus*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*], oligonucleotide primers were designed for [$RT-PCR#Method*] amplification of a previously unknown segment of the [@BPW#Gene*] gene from a Greek isolate and the American isolate of the virus.
The [$RT-PCR#Method*] products of both isolates were cloned and found to be identical in sequence.
[@Computer-assisted analysis#Method*] of the deduced amino acid sequence of the assembled [$HSP70#Gene*] homolog gene fragments showed that [$BPW#Gene*] and [$CYSDV#Virus*] are closely related to each other and individually as closely related to the corresponding gene of [$lettuce#Plant*] infectious yellows virus, which is the prototype member of the recently proposed [@Crinivirus genus#Virus*] of [$whitefly#Virus*]-transmitted bipartite closteroviruses.
