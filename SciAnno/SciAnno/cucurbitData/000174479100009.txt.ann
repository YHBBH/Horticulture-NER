[@Root and stem rot#Disease*] of [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), caused by [@Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.radicis-cricumerinum#Virus*], is a new catastrophic disease of greenhouse [$crops#Plant*] in Greece and some other countries.
No effective disease control methods are available, apart from soil disinfestation by fumigation with methyl bromide and disinfection of internal space of greenhouses with a formaldehyde solution.
However, it is anticipated that the use of methyl bromide will be phased out in Greece by 1 January 2005.
Therefore, alternative measures for disease management are urgently required.
In this study, the efficacy of grafting commercial Dutch type [$cucumber#Plant*] hybrids onto various [$cucurbits#Plant*], used as rootstocks, was examined in growth [@chamber and greenhouse experiments#Method*].
Of the nine commercial [@Cucurbita spp.#Plant*]evaluated, six, A27, [@Cucurbita Ficifolia#Plant*], Patron F-1., Peto 42.91 F-1, TS- 1358 F-1, and TZ- 148 F-1, found resistant to [@F oxysporum f.sp.radicis-cucumerinum#Virus*], were selected to serve in subsequent greenhouse experiments as rootstocks for grafting the susceptible cv.Brunex F-1.
Of these, Peto 42.91 F-1, TS-1358 F-1, and TZ-148 F-1 were found to be superior to the others due to their horticultural performance under the climatic conditions prevailing in Crete during the [$cucumber#Plant*] [$crop#Plant*] season, late October to late May.
This study shows that grafting commercial Dutch type [$cucumber#Plant*] hybrids onto various resistant[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] rootstocks could be used as an alternative control method to methyl bromide for [@root and stem rot#Disease*].
