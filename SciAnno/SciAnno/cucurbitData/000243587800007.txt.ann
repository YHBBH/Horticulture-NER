[@Malvaceous plants#Plant*] have not been known as hosts for any of the recognized [@tobamovirus species#Virus*] until quite recently.
Three sub-groups of [$tobamoviruses#Virus*] have been described that infect [@solanaceous plants#Plant*], [$brassicas#Plant*], and [$cucurbits#Plant*] or [@legumes#Plant*].
We recently isolated a new [$tobamovirus species#Virus*], [@Hibiscus latent Fort Pierce virus#Virus*] ([@HLFPV#Virus*]) from landscape plantings of the [@malvaceous plant hibiscus #Plant*]([@Hibiscus rosa-sinensis#Plant*]) in Florida, and a related [$hibiscus#Plant*]-infecting [$tobamovirus#Virus*], [@Hibiscus latent Singapore virus#Virus*] ([@HLSV#Virus*]), has been reported from Singapore.
The experimental host range of [$HLFPV#Virus*] is mostly limited to the [@Malvaceae#Plant*], which includes fiber and [$food crops#Plant*] such as [$cotton#Plant*], [$kenaf#Plant*] and [$okra#Plant*], in addition to economically important ornamental [$crops#Plant*] like [$hibiscus#Plant*].
[@Serological and molecular methods#Method*] were compared to evaluate their usefulness for diagnosis of [$HLFPV#Virus*].
An initial survey by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] for [$HLFPV#Virus*] in landscape [$hibiscus#Plant*] plants in Florida has shown a high level (56%) of incidence.
[@Subsequent analysis#Method*] of related malvaceous species has identified [$HLFPV#Virus*] infection of Turk's cap ([@Malvaviscus arboreus#Plant*]), [$rose#Plant*] of Sharon ([@H.syriacus#Plant*]), [@scarlet rosemallow#Plant*] ([@H.coccineus#Plant*]) and common [@rosemallow#Plant*] ([@H.moscheutos#Plant*]).
A similar virus has been detected in [@H.rosa-sinensis#Plant*] in Thailand by [@tissue-blot immunoassay#Method*].
Cloning of the [$coat protein gene#Gene*] of Thai virus isolates and [@subsequent analysis#Method*] showed the nucleotide and amino acid sequences to be nearly identical to [$HLFPV#Virus*].
[@Dixie rosemallow#Plant*] ([@H.matabilis#Plant*]) and [$H.rosa-sinensis#Plant*] plants have been found in Florida infected with [$tobamoviruses#Virus*] that are serologically distinct from [$HLFPV#Virus*] but related to [$HLSV#Virus*].
Cloning and sequencing of the [$HLFPV#Virus*] genome indicate that it is distinct from but related to [$HLSV#Virus*].
However, the [$coat protein gene#Gene*]s and deduced proteins of [$HLFPV#Virus*] and [$HLSV#Virus*] are only 37-53% identical to all other [$tobamovirus species#Virus*], suggesting the existence of a malvaceous-infecting subgroup of [$tobamoviruses#Virus*].
