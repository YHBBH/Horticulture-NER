[@Calla lily chlorotic spot virus#Virus*] ([@CCSV#Virus*]) collected from calla lily plants showing symptoms in Taiwan has been identified as a tentative species of the genus [$Tospovirus#Virus*] based on the comparison of S RNA sequences.
In this investigation, the complete sequences of its L and M RNAs were determined.
The L RNA contains 8911 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of 2882 amino acids (aa) (332 kDa) in the viral complementary (vc) sense.
The M RNA was shown to be 4704 nt in length, encoding a nonstructural NSm protein of 309 aa (35 kDa) in the viral sense and a Gn/Gc glycoprotein precursor (GP) of 1123 aa (128 kDa) in the vc sense.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] of the individual tospoviral proteins indicated that [$CCSV#Virus*] is closely related to [@Tomato zonate spot virus#Virus*], a new tentative [$tospovirus#Virus*] isolated from [$tomato#Plant*] in southern China.
Two degenerate primer pairs gL2740/gL3920c and gM410/gM870c, designed, after sequence comparison, from the highly conserved regions of the L and NSm genes, respectively, were successfully used to detect 12 greenhouse-cultured [@tospoviruses#Virus*], including six formal species and six tentative species, by [$reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction#Method*].
They were also used to detect [$Melon yellow spot virus#Virus*] and [$Watermelon silver mottle virus#Virus*] from field [$cucurbit #Plant*]samples in Taiwan.
The results indicate that the two degenerate primer pairs can be used for prompt detection of most [$tospoviruses#Virus*] and exploration of unknown [$tospovirus#Virus*] species.
