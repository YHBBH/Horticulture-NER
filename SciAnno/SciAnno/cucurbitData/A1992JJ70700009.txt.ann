AB A rapid, reliable bioassay for large-scale screening of pathogenicity of [$Colletotrichum magna#Virus*], a causal agent of [@anthracnose#Disease*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*], was developed.
This method involved exposing whole [$seedlings#Plant*] and cuttings (plants with excised root systems) to [$conidia#Virus*]l suspensions in scintillation vials.
The results corresponded well to disease responses observed by the standard leaf inoculation procedures.
This continuous dip method allowed for a rapid disease response in cuttings; mortality occurred within 48-72 hr after inoculation.
The method was also reliable for determining susceptible and resistant [$cucurbit cultivar#Plant*]s and enabled screening of more than 300 UV-irradiated potential pathogenicity mutants.
Three nonpathogenic mutants, isolates HU 25, HU 36, and HU 43, were identified.
Isolate HU 25 did not cause mortality in whole plants but did induce a hypersensitive response when [$conidia#Virus*] were assayed on cotyledons.
The [$banana#Plant*]-specific [$pathogen#Virus*], [@C.musae#Virus*], did not cause disease in cuttings and cotyledon-inoculated [$seedlings#Plant*].
The proposed method enables rapid, reliable, and large-scale screening, and requires less time and greenhouse space than the standard leaf inoculation techniques.
The continuous dip method may also be well-suited for screening pathogenicity in isolates of soilborne fungi and especially for evaluating resistance of cultivars to wilt pathogens.
