[@Watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.& Nakai#Plant*]) is an important plant in the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
[$Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm#Virus*] [[@anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum (Fr.) Sacc.#Virus*]] is the causative agent of [$gummy stem blight#Disease*] ([@GSB#Disease*]), a disease affecting members of the [$family Cucurbitaceae#Plant*].
[$Watermelon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*] showing varied degree (20-90%) of suspected GSBs were collected from seedling companies in Antalya province, Turkey.
The symptoms included angular water-soaked lesions, which turned tan over time; defoliation; dry, pale green stem; stem necrosis; gummy exudates; wilt; and the eventual death of the upper parts of the seedling plants.
The growth of the fungal isolate in vitro showed white aerial and olivaceous mycelium, and olive to dark green or black substrate mycelium at the latter period of fungal growth.
The colony surface was rough and undulated.
The [$conidia#Virus*] were round-ended, cylindrical, monoseptate, and hyaline.
The [$conidia#Virus*] ranged from 6.4 to 13.6 pm in length and 3.69-4.68 gm in diameter.
The isolates were subjected to [@PCR using three primers#Method*], namely, DB-F3/[$DB#Virus*]-R3, [@GSB#Disease*]F1/[@GSB#Disease*]R1, and ITS1/ITS4, which produced fragment sizes of approxi[$mate#Plant*]ly 120, 780, and 560 bp, respectively.
The [$real-time PCR#Method*] using DB-F3/DB-R3 primer and SYBR Green fluorescence dye produced positive result for the samples tested.
The [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]isolate was [$pathogen#Virus*]ic to all the four different [$cucurbits#Plant*] tested and were consistently re-isolated from the diseased [$seedlings#Plant*] confirming their [$pathogen#Virus*]ic status and thereby satisfying Koch's postulates.
This is the second report confirming the presence of [$D.bryoniae #Virus*]in Turkey after its first detection in [$cucumber#Plant*] in 2015.
