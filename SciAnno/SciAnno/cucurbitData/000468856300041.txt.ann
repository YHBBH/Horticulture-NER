Interspecific hybrid [@squash#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata#Plant*]) [$rootstocks#Plant*] used to graft [$watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]) are resistant to [$Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*], the [$fungus#Virus*] that causes [$Fusarium wilt of watermelon#Disease*], but they are susceptible to [$Meloidogyne incognita#Virus*], the southern root knot nematode.
A new [$citron#Plant*] ([$Citrullus amarus#Virus*]) rootstock cultivar Carolina Strongback is resistant to [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] and [$M.incognita#Virus*].
The objective of this study was to determine if an interaction between [$M.incognita#Virus*] and [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum race 2#Virus*] occurred on grafted or nongrafted triploid [$watermelon#Plant*] susceptible to [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum race 2#Virus*].
In 2016 and 2018, plants of non grafted cultivar Fascination and Fascination grafted onto Carolina Strongback and interspe[$cific hyb#Method*]rid [$squash #Plant*]cultivar Carnivor were inoculated or not inoculated with [$M.incognita#Virus*] before transplanting into field plots infested or not infested with [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum race 2#Virus*].
Incidence of [$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] and area under the disease progress curve did not differ when hosts were inoculated with [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] alone or [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] and [$M.incognita#Virus*] together.
[$Fusarium wilt#Disease*] was greater on nongrafted [$watermelon#Plant*] (78% mean incidence) than on both grafted rootstocks and lower on Carnivor (1% incidence) than on Carolina Strongback (12% incidence; P <= 0.01).
Plants not inoculated with [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] did not wilt.
At the end of the season, Carnivor had a greater percentage of the root system galled than the other two hosts, whereas galling did not differ on Fascination and Carolina Strongback.
[$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] reduced marketable weight of nongrafted Fascination with and without coinoculation with [$M.incognita#Virus*].[$M.incognita#Virus*] reduced marketable weight of Fascination grafted onto Carnivor compared with noninoculated, nongrafted Fascination.
In conclusion, [$cucurbit #Plant*]rootstocks that are susceptible and resistant to [$M.incognita#Virus*] retain resistance to [$F.oxysporum f.sp.niveum#Virus*] when they are coinfected with [$M.incognita#Virus*].
