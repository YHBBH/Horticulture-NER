[@Bacterial wilt#Disease*] is one of the most destructive diseases of [$cucurbits#Plant*] in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States.
Although the disease has been studied since 1900, host colonization dynamics remain unclear.
[$Cucumis#Plant*]- and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]-derived strains exhibit host preference for the [$cucurbit #Plant*]genus from which they were isolated.
We constructed a bioluminescent strain of [$Erwinia tracheiphila#Virus*] (TedCu10-BL#9) and colonization of different [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts was monitored.
At the second-true-leaf stage, [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] plants were inoculated with TedCu10-BL#9 via wounded leaves, stems, and roots.
Daily monitoring of colonization showed bioluminescent bacteria in the inoculated leaf and petiole beginning 1 day postinoculation (DPI).
The bacteria spread to roots via the stem by 2 DPI, reached the plant extremities 4 DPI, and the plant wilted 6 DPI.
However,[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] plants inoculated with TedCu10-BL#9 did not wilt, even at 35 DPI.
Bioluminescent bacteria were detected 6 DPI in the main stem of [$squash #Plant*]and [$pumpkin#Plant*] plants, which harbored approximately 104 and 101 CFU/g, respectively, of TedCu10-BL#9 without symptoms.
Although significantly less systemic plant colonization was observed in nonpreferred host[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] plants compared with preferred hosts, the mechanism of tolerance of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] plants to [$E.tracheiphila#Plant*] strains from [$Cucumis#Plant*] remains unknown.
