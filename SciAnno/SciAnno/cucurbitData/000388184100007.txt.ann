[@Phytophthora capsici#Virus*] annually threatens production of [$cucurbit #Plant*]and [$solanaceous crops#Plant*].
Long-lived oospores produced by the [$pathogen#Virus*] incite primary infection of susceptible plants when conditions are wet.
Limiting the rot of [$winter squash#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita sp.#Plant*]) fruits is difficult due to the long maturation period when fruits are often in direct contact with infested soil.
[$Genetic resistance#Method*] to fruit rot is not widely available within[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] sp.; however, age-related resistance (ARR) to [@P.capsici#Virus*] fruit rot develops in specific cultivars during maturation.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the fruits of 12 cultivars of[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata, and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima for ARR to [$P.capsici#Plant*] using a mycelial-plug inoculation method.
All[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] moschata cultivars displayed ARR; 7 days postpollination (dpp) fruits were susceptible, limited lesion development occurred on fruits 22 dpp, and lesions did not develop at 56 dpp.
Disease developed on both[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] maxima cultivars tested at 7, 14, 22, and 56 dpp.
Firmness of fruit exocarps was measured with a manual penetrometer.
Exocarp firmness of all cultivars increased during maturation; however, there was no correlation between firmness and disease incidence among cultivars at 22 dpp (R-2 = -0.01, P = 0.85).
When fruits of cultivars expressing ARR at 22 dpp were wounded before inoculation, fruit rot developed.
