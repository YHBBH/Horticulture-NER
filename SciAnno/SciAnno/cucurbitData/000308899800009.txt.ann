The genetic structure of [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] populations.
Plant Dis.
96:1459-1470.
   [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] is a destructive [@foliar pathogen#Virus*] of economically important [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*] in the United States and worldwide.
In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of 465 P.
cubensis isolates from three continents, 13 countries, 19 states of the United States, and five host species [@using five nuclear and two mitochondrial loci#Method*].
Bayesian clustering resolved six genetic clusters and suggested some population structure by geographic origin and host, because some clusters occurred more or less frequently in particular categories.
All of the genetic clusters were present in the sampling from North America and Europe.
Differences in cluster occurrence were observed by country and state.
Isolates from [$cucumber#Plant*] had different cluster composition and lower genetic diversity than isolates from other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Because genetic structuring was detected, isolates that represent the genetic variation in [@P.cubensis#Virus*] should be used when developing diagnostic tools, [$fungicides#Plant*], and resistant host varieties.
Although this study provides an initial map of global population structure of [$P cubensis#Virus*], future genotyping of isolates could reveal population structure within specific geographic regions, across a wider range of hosts, or during different time points during the growing season.
