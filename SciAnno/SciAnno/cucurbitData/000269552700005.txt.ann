[@Cucumis melo#Plant*] accession PI 313970 possesses numerous genes for race-specific resistance to[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] incited by [@Podosphaera xanthii#Virus*].
It also exhibits resistant blister (RB) leaf reactions, characteristic for non-race-specificity, to several races of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] in California, U.S.A.
Microscopic examination confirmed the presence of mycelia, conidiophores and [$conidia#Virus*], and limited number of necrotic cells within and limited to RB tissue.
PI 313970 was susceptible to inoculation with Czech isolates of [@P.xanthii#Virus*] and [$Golovinomyces cichoracearum#Virus*] on leaf discs.
Frequency of [$conidia#Virus*]l germination did not differ between [$pathogen#Virus*] species, or between PI 313970 and the susceptible [$cucumber#Plant*] cv.
'Stela'control, but number of germ tubes and appressoria, mycelial growth and [$conidia#Virus*]l production of both [$pathogens#Virus*] through 144 hours post-inoculation were reduced in comparison with the susceptible control.
Hypersensitive responses (HR) were not observed in 'Stela', but occurred to a limited extent in PI 313970 where <= 3% of examined sites had necrotic spots.
These responses indicate two different resistance mechanisms to these[$ powdery mildew#Virus*] isolates in PI 313970.
The first mechanism targets [$conidia#Virus*]l germination and appressoria formation.
The second mechanism reduces [$pathogen#Virus*] growth and reproduction with minimal or no HR involvement and may be influenced by the first mechanism.
Resistant blisters, observed only on intact leaves evidence a third and non-race-specific mechanism to [@P.xanthii#Virus*] and [@G.cichoracearum#Virus*] in PI 313970, based on our histological study.
