The laboratory germination (radicle emergence) percentages of 9 [@watermelon#Plant*], 12 [$melon#Plant*], and 7 [$cucumber#Plant*] seed lots were tested after storing in relatively adverse storage conditions of 25 degrees C and 12% me for 6, 12, and 18 months in sealed aluminum foil packets.
The laboratory germination (radicle emergence) of lots was determined after controlled deterioration (CD) at 45 degrees C with 20% or 24% moisture content (me) for 48, 72, 96,120, and 144 h.
[@The accelerated aging test (AA)#Method*] was conducted at 45 degrees C for the same aging periods.
A number of seed lots was dead by 12 and 18 months in [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*], respectively.
Various combinations of test regimens were found to be correlated with laboratory germination after 6 months storage, but the most consistent regimens for AA tests was 96 h at 45 degrees C in all species (r = 0.71 to 0.98).
In the CD tests, 72 h with 20% me at 45 degrees C gave the best correlation (r = 0.86 to 0.96).
These conditions of highest correlation were observed after laboratory germination after 6 months storage and are suggested as good predictors of storage life in [$cucurbit#Plant*] seed lots.
The initial standard germination before storage was also significantly correlated with seed longevity, but the correlation coefficient was generally lower (r = 0.60 to 0.83) than the AA and CD test results and separation of lots less clear.
