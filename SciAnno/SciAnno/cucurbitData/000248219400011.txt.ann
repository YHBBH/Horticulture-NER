Mostly the farmers are growing [@cucurbits#Plant*] during their normal growing season by sowing of seeds and when such [$vegetables#Plant*] are harvested for marketing, the markets are flooded with these [$vegetables#Plant*] and the growers sometimes are even not getting back their cost of production.
But the same [$vegetables#Plant*] are fetching very high price during their off-season availability.
[$Seedlings #Plant*]of these [$vegetables#Plant*] can not be raised through the traditional system of nursery growing in soil media because these [$vegetables#Plant*] can not tolerate slight damage to their root and shoot system.
But few years back a technology was developed for off-season cultivation of these [$crops#Plant*] under which [$seedlings#Plant*] of these [$cucurbits#Plant*] were raised in polybags by using soil and compost as media, but this technology is expensive, needs lot of protected space and labour, and the plastic of the polyethylene bags is a problem for the environment.
At the IndoIsrael Project of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, plug-tray nursery raising technology by using cocopeat, vermiculite and perlite as soilless media has been standardized for raising off-season [$seedlings#Plant*] of almost all the [$cucurbitaceous vegetables#Plant*].
This technique is capable of vigorous root development, suitable for nursery raising without any damage to the [$seedlings#Plant*].
This technology is quite economical for the [$vegetable#Plant*] growers of the northern plains of India, because with the introduction of this technique, farmers can grow a large number of [$seedlings#Plant*] as per requirement for off-season cultivation of these [$cucurbits#Plant*] for fetching high price of the off-season produce.
The plug-tray nursery raising technology by using soilless media can be extended to the growers in various parts of northern India for growing offseason [$cucurbitaceous vegetables#Plant*].
