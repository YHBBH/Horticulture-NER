[@Using an electrostatic rotational spore collector#Method*], we consecutively collected all of the [$conidia#Virus*] produced from single colonies of [@melon powdery mildew#Virus*] ([@Podosphaera xanthii Pollacci KMP-6N#Virus*]) on leaves of living [$melon plants#Plant*] throughout the lifetime of the colony in a natural environment, and counted all [$conidia#Virus*] that were attracted to insulators.
The collector consisted of an insulated round plastic container, a conductor (copper) film, an insulator (collector) film, an electrostatic voltage generator and a timer mechanism.
Negative charge was supplied from the voltage generator to the conductor film, and the negatively charged conductor film caused dielectric polarization of the insulator film.
The insulator film, which creates an attractive force for trapping [$conidia#Virus*] that enter the field, was placed ca.
2cm from the apex of the single colony.
Released [$conidia#Virus*] were successfully attracted to the electrostatically activated insulator films.
Each collector film was exchanged for a new insulator film at 24h intervals until KMP-6N ceased to release [$conidia#Virus*] from single colonies.
During a colony's lifespan, KMP-6N released an average of 12.6x10(4) [$conidia#Virus*] from each of the single colonies at ca.
744h.
Additionally, we found that 1) the number of [$conidia#Virus*] released from single colonies in daytime was larger than that in night-time, 2) [$conidia#Virus*] were released from single colonies for ca.
2-4h longer in spring or summer than in autumn or winter, and 3) release of [$conidia#Virus*] from KMP-6N decreased as light intensity declined.
Thus, [$conidia#Virus*]l release from conidiophores is affected by day-length and light intensity.
