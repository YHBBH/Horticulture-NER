[@Angular leaf spot of cucurbits#Disease*] is generally considered to be caused by [@Pseudomonas syringae pv.lachrymans#Virus*].
It has a worldwide distribution and has been observed to emerge sporadically under humid and wet conditions.
Reports of multiple [$P.syringae pathovars#Virus*] associated with the disease and lack of [$molecular analysis#Method*] has left the true diversity of populations in the United States unclear.
In this study, we collected 27 [@P.syringae#Virus*] strains causing foliar le[$sions#Plant*] and blighting on [$watermelon#Plant*], [$cantaloupe#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*]in Florida, Georgia, and California over several years.
Strains were fluorescent on King's medium B agar and displayed the typical phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of [$P.syringae#Virus*].
[$P.syringae#Virus*] pv.lachrymans is a member of genomospecies 2.
However, the genetic profiles obtained through both [$MLSA#Method*] (gyrB, rpoD, gapA, and gltA) and [$BOX-PCR#Method*] (BOXA1R) identified 26 of the [@P.syringae#Virus*] strains to be distributed among three clades within genomospecies 1, and phylogenetically distinct from genomospecies 2 member [@P.syringae pv.lachrymans#Virus*].
A novel [$MLSA#Method*] haplotype of the [$pathogen#Virus*] common to all states and [$cucurbit #Plant*]hosts was identified.
Considerable genetic diversity among [$P.syringae#Virus*] strains [$infe#Plant*]cting [$cucurbits#Plant*] is associated with the same disease, and reflects the larger ecological diversity of [$P.syringae#Virus*] populations from genomospecies 1.
