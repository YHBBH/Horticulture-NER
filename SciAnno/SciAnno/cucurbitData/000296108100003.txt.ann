Field and laboratory bioassay studies were conducted to determine the impact of [@Brassicaceae cover crops#Plant*] on [$cucurbit #Plant*]germination percentages and stand counts.
A 2-year field study in southwestern Michigan examined the effect of [@oilseed radish#Plant*] ([@Raphanus sativus var.oleiferus#Plant*]), [@oriental mustard#Plant*] ([@Brassica juncea#Plant*]), and [@yellow mustard#Plant*] ([@Sinapis alba#Plant*]) [$green manures#Plant*] on [$muskmelon#Plant*] ([@Cucumis melo Group reticulatus#Plant*]) stand.
All three [$cover crops#Plant*] reduced direct-seeded [$muskmelon#Plant*] stand count as well as transplant survival.
Stand count for direct- seeded [$muskmelon#Plant*] was greater than 85% for control and methyl bromide treatments and less than 41% for cover [$crop#Plant*] treatments.
Oilseed radish had the greatest effect with 0% [$muskmelon#Plant*] stand in both years.
The use of transplants improved [$muskmelon#Plant*] stand establishment.
However, stand count (less than 45% to 50%) was still unacceptable.
In bioassays, [$muskmelon#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), and [$honeydew melon#Plant*] ([$Cucumis#Plant*] ludo Group inodorus) seeds were exposed to either non-lyophilized or lyophilized root and shoot aqueous extracts of [$oilseed radish#Plant*].
Germination percentages and radicle elongation measurements showed both extracts impacted all three [$crops#Plant*] to varying degrees.
[$Muskmelon#Plant*] germination was least sensitive to the extracts, followed by [$cucumber#Plant*], then [$honeydew#Plant*].
[$Cucumber#Plant*] and [$muskmelon#Plant*] root growth was equally inhibited by non-lyophilized shoot extract, while [$honeydew#Plant*] growth was mildly stimulated at 5% and 12.5% concentrations.
Overall, non-lyophilized root extract showed stronger inhibition on [$seed germ#Plant*]ination than non-lyophilized shoot extract, while the reverse was true of lyophilized extracts.
In general, non-lyophilized extracts had far greater impact on germination percentages and radicle elongation than lyophilized extracts.
These results suggest species and tissue dependent toxicity of the [$cover crops#Plant*] as well as differential susceptibility of the [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] tested.
Therefore, a plant-back period longer than the 8 days used in this study should be observed after cover [$crop#Plant*] incorporation before [$cucurbit #Plant*]seeding or transplanting.
