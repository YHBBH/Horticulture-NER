Organic inputs have been suggested to have either suppressive or conducive effects on levels of plant diseases.
In this study, we compared effects of organic matter amendments and transitional [$crop#Plant*]ping systems on plant diseases during the transition from conventional to organic agricultural production and 2 yr following.
During the 3-yr transition, organic amendments included raw dairy manure, composted dairy manure, and non-amended treatment superimposed on three cropping systems (perennial pasture, [@cash grain crops#Plant*], and [$vegetable crops#Plant*]).
Two years of post-transition [$crops#Plant*] included [$tomato#Plant*] ([$Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.#Plant*]) and [$bell pepper#Plant*] ([$Capsicum annuum L.#Plant*]var.annuum) in the first year and [$soybean#Plant*] [[@Glycine max (L.) Merr.#Plant*]] in the second.
During transition, raw manure amendments resulted in higher levels of diseases caused by some biotrophic [$pathogens#Virus*], including rusts in [$corn#Plant*] ([@Zea mays L.#Plant*]) and [@orchardgrass#Plant*] ([@Dactylis glomerata L.#Plant*]).
However, raw manure applications were also found to suppress some diseases caused by necrotrophic [$pathogens#Virus*], including [$anthracnose#Virus*] and Septoria leaf spot in [$tomato#Plant*].
Manure applications promoted higher [$soybean#Plant*] yields.
[$Powdery mildew of cucurbits#Disease*] ([@Curbubita moschata Duchesne#Virus*]) was suppressed by composted manure.
After transition, [$tomato#Plant*] plants grown in plots previously under the [$vegetable#Plant*] system had the highest levels of [$anthracnose#Virus*], and [$soybean#Plant*] grown in plots previously in the pasture system had the highest levels of bacterial pustule, despite the fact that these same plots produced the highest yields in [$soybean#Plant*].
Yield benefits resulting from applications of raw manure to a pasture transition system may be attractive for farmers, but disease management strategies will need to be considered to prevent increased disease levels.
