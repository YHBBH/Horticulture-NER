The biocompatible products AQ10 ([@hyperparasitic fungus Ampelomyces quisqualis#Virus*]), JMS Stylet-Oil (medium viscosity mineral oil), M-Pede (potassium salts of fatty acids) and Kaligreen (82% potassium bicarbonate) suppressed, [$powdery mildew#Disease*] ([@Sphaerotheca fusca#Virus*]) on [@winter squash#Plant*], [$muskmelon#Plant*], and [$pumpkin#Plant*] and increased yield compared with nontreated plants under field conditions.
Applications were started after disease detection.
JMS Stylet-Oil most effectively controlled [$powdery mildew#Disease*].
However, these products did not provide the degree of full-season control or yield increase obtained with the conventional [$fungicide#Method*] program of Brave (chlorothalonil) plus Nova (myclobutanil).
For example, in [$muskmelon#Plant*] on 17 August 1995, 7 days after the third application, [$powdery mildew#Disease*] severity on upper and lower (under) leaf surfaces was 66 and 80% for untreated, 3 and 13% for Brave plus Nova, 43 and 44% for JMS Stylet-Oil, 38 and 65% for AQ10, and 53 and 65% for Kaligreen, respectively.
Yield (ton/ha) was 22.8, 44.2, 36.4, 40.6, and 38.5, respectively.
Sucrose content was 3.5%, 6.6%, 4.6%, 3.2%, and 4.0%, respectively.
