AB Brushing (40 strokes per 1.5 minutes, twice daily) or moisture stress conditioning (MSC) (daily nonlethal dry-down cycles) reduced seedling growth of two [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Virus*]) cultivars in 1991 and three [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*]) cultivars in 1991 and 1992.
In both years, [$watermelon#Plant*] [[@Citrullus lanatus Thunb.(Matsum.& Nakai)#Plant*]] cultivars varied in responsiveness to brushing; brushing reduced stem length 0% to 44% over four cultivars in 1992.
MSC reduced growth of all cultivars.
Brushing increased the rate of water loss from detached leaves of [$cucumber#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*], whereas MSC decreased water loss from leaves of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*].
In 1991, under well-watered posttransplant conditions, MSC increased the mean relative growth rate (RGR) of [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$watermelon#Plant*] transplants in the greenhouse.
Brushing increased the RGR of [$watermelon#Plant*] transplants.
In 1992, MSC increased the RGR of [$squash #Plant*]and [$watermelon#Plant*] transplants grown under posttransplant drought-stressed conditions, while brushing had no effect.
Both conditioning treatments controlled plant growth in the greenhouse without diminishing subsequent plant performance.
