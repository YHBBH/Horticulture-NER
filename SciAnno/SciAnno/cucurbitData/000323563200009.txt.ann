The [@watermelon#Plant*], [$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*] ([$Cucurbitaceae#Virus*]), is an important fruit [$vegetable#Plant*] in the warmer regions of the world.
[$Watermelon#Plant*]s were illustrated in Mediterranean Antiquity, but not as frequently as some other [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Little is known concerning the [$watermelons#Plant*] of Mediterranean Europe during medieval times.
With the objective of obtaining an improved understanding of [$watermelon#Plant*] history and diversity in this region, medieval drawings purportedly of [$watermelons#Plant*] were collected, examined and compared for originality, detail and accuracy.
   The oldest manuscript found that contains an accurate, informative image of [$watermelon#Plant*] is the Tractatus de herbis, British Library ms.
Egerton 747, which was produced in southern Italy, around the year 1300.
A dozen more original illustrations were found, most of them from Italy, produced during the ensuing two centuries that can be positively identified as [$watermelon#Plant*].
In most herbal-type manuscripts, the foliage is depicted realistically, the plants shown as having long internodes, alternate leaves with pinnatifid leaf laminae, and the fruits are small, round and striped.
The manuscript that contains the most detailed and accurate image of [$watermelon#Plant*] is the Carrara Herbal, British Library ms.
Egerton 2020.
In the agriculture-based manuscripts, the foliage, if depicted, is not accurate, but variation in the size, shape and coloration of the fruits is evident.
Both red-flesh and white-flesh [$watermelons#Plant*] are illustrated, corresponding to the typical [$sweet#Plant*] dessert [$watermelons#Plant*] so common today and the insipid citron [$watermelons#Plant*], respectively.
The variation in [$watermelon#Plant*] fruit size, shape and coloration depicted in the illustrations indicates that at least six cultivars of [$watermelon#Plant*] are represented, three of which probably had red, sweet flesh and three of which appear to have been citrons.
Evidently, citron [$watermelons#Plant*] were more common in Mediterranean Europe in the past than they are today.
