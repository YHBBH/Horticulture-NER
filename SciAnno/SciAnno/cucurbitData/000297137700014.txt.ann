The antibacterial potential of four strains of [@Bacillus subtilis#Virus*], UMAF6614, UMAF6619, UMAF6639, and UMAF8561, previously selected on the basis of their antifungal activity and efficacy against [$cucurbit powdery mildew#Virus*], was examined.
Among these strains, UMAF6614 and UMAF6639 showed the highest antibacterial activity in vitro, especially against [@Xanthomonas campestris pv.cucurbitae#Virus*] and [@Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.carotovorum#Virus*].
These strains produced the three families of lipopeptide antibiotics known in [$Bacillus spp#Virus*].: surfactins, iturins, and fengycins.
[@Using thin-layer chromatography analysis and direct bioautography#Method*], the antibacterial activity could be associated with iturin lipo-peptides.
This result was confirmed by [@mutagenesis analysis using lipopeptide-defective mutants#Method*].
The antibacterial activity was practically abolished in iturin-deficient mutants, whereas the fengycin mutants retained certain inhibitory capabilities.
[@Analyses by fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy#Method*] revealed the cytotoxic effect of these compounds at the bacterial plasma membrane level.
Finally, biological control assays on detached [$melon#Plant*] leaves demonstrated the ability of UMAF6614 and UMAF6639 to suppress bacterial leaf spot and soft rot; accordingly, the biocontrol activity was practically abolished in mutants deficient in iturin biosynthesis.
Taken together, our results highlight the potential of these [$B.subtilis#Virus*] strains as biocontrol agents against fungal and bacterial diseases of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and the versatility of iturins as antifungal and antibacterial compounds.
