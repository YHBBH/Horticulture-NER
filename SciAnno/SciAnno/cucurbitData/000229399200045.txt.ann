Halosulfuron is a proposed alternative to methyl bromide for managing [@nutsedges#Plant*] ([$Cyperus spp.#Plant*]) in several [$vegetable crops#Plant*], including [$cucurbits#Plant*].
Field studies were conducted to evaluate the [$crop#Plant*] sensitivity to halosulfuron in a spring [$squash #Plant*]([$Cucurbita pepo L#Plant*].)-fall [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus L.#Plant*]) rotation from 2000 to 2002.
Treatments included application of halosulfuron to the soil surface after forming the bed, but before laying mulch (halosulfuron-PRE), halosulfuron applied through drip irrigation (halosulfuron-DRIP) after forming bed and laying mulch, metham applied through drip irrigation after forming bed and laying mulch, a nontreated control with mulch, and nontreated control without mulch.
Each treatment was applied to both direct seeded and transplanted [$zucchini squash#Plant*].
Halosulfuron treatments reduced [$squash #Plant*]plant diameter relative to metham, however plant diameters in halosulfuron-PRE (transplant and direct seed) and halosulfuron-DRIP (transplant) treatments were not different from the nontreated control.
Halosulfuron-PRE delayed [$squash #Plant*]fruit production relative to the mulched nontreated control, However, application of halosulfuron-PRE and halosulfuron-DRIP did not reduce [$squash #Plant*]yield at the conclusion of the season, relative to the nontreated control.
[$Cucumber#Plant*]s were transplanted and direct seeded into previous [$squash #Plant*]plots and received either an application of halosulfuron-DRIP, or were not treated.
Differences in [$cucumber#Plant*] yields were not detected with second [$crop#Plant*] treatments.
[$Cucumber#Plant*]s ap[$pea#Plant*]r to have adequate tolerance to halosulfuron, making it a potential replacement for methyl bromide for [$nuts#Plant*]edge control.
Suppression of early season [$squash #Plant*]growth by halosulfuron may hinder the adoption of halosulfuron as a methyl bromide alternative for [$squash#Plant*].
