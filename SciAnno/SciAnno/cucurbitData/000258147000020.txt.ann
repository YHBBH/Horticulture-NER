[@Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]) was previously found to be associated with severe yellowing and chlorosis in field-grown [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Costa Rica.
To determine the prevalence and molecular variability of [$BPYV#Virus*] in Costa Rica, leaf samples were collected in 2004 and 2005 from symptomatic [$cucurbit plants#Plant*] growing in geographically distinct [$cucurbit#Plant*]-growing regions, and [@weedy plants#Plant*] growing adjacent to production fields.
The samples were tested for the presence of [$BPYV#Virus*] using [@RT-PCR with virus-specific primers#Method*] and [@nucleic acid hybridization probes specific#Method*] for genes encoding the [$BPYV#Virus*] minor [$coat protein#Gene*], heat shock protein, and polymerase protein.
Several isolates were also amplified using primers spanning an insertion region in RNA1 to examine isolate variability.
Our results revealed that (1) [$BPYV#Virus*] in [$cucurbits#Plant*] is currently limited to an isolated region of the country, (2) genetic variation in the genes examined among the isolates is very low, and (3) [$BPYV#Virus*] is present in wild [$cucurbit#Plant*] and other plant species growing adjacent to production fields containing [$BPYV#Virus*]-positive [$cucurbits#Plant*].
