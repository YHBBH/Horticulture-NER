[@Chayote mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@ChMV#Virus*]) is a putative [@tymovirus#Virus*] isolated from [@chayote crops#Plant*] in Costa Rica.
[$ChMV#Virus*] was characterized at the host range, serological, and molecular levels.
[$ChMV#Virus*] was transmitted mechanically and induced disease symptoms mainly in [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] hosts.
[@Asymptomatic infections#Method*] were detected in other host families.
Serologically, [$ChMV#Virus*] is related to the [@Andean potato latent virus#Virus*] ([@APLV#Virus*]) and the [@Eggplant mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@EMV#Virus*]), both members of the genus [$Tymovirus#Virus*] infecting [$solanaceous #Plant*]hosts in the Caribbean Basin and South America.
The sequence of the genomic RNA of [$ChMV#Virus*] was determined and its genetic organization was typical of [@tymoviruses#Virus*].
Comparisons with other tymoviral sequences showed that [$ChMV#Virus*] was a new member of the genus [$Tymovirus#Virus*].
The [@phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of the [$coat protein#Gene*] gene were consistent with serological comparisons and positioned [$ChMV#Virus*] within a cluster of [$tymoviruses#Virus*] infecting mainly [$cucurbit#Plant*] or [$solanaceous #Plant*]hosts, including [$APLV#Virus*] and [$EMV#Virus*].
[@Phylogenetic analyses#Method*] of the replicase protein gene confirmed the close relationship of [$ChMV#Virus*] and [$EMV#Virus*].
Our results suggest that [$ChMV#Virus*] is related to two [$tymoviruses#Virus*] ([$APLV#Virus*] and [$EMV#Virus*]) of proximal geographical provenance but with different natural host ranges.
[$ChMV#Virus*] is the first [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting [$tymovirus#Virus*] to be fully characterized at the genomic level.
