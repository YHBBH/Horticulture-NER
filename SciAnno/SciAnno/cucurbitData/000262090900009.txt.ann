[@Curly top disease (CTD) of vegetable crops#Disease*] is caused by viruses in the [@genus Curtovirus#Virus*] ([@family Geminiviridae#Virus*]).
[$Cucurbits#Plant*] are reported to be susceptible to CTD; however, the disease is rare in California despite annual outbreaks in other hosts (e.g., [$common bean#Plant*], [$pepper#Plant*], [$sugar beet#Plant*], and [$tomato#Plant*]).
Consistent with these observations, no obvious curly top symptoms were observed in [$melon#Plant*] fields surveyed for CTD in Central California in 2004 and 2005, whereas the disease was readily observed in [$tomato#Plant*] plants in nearby fields.
However, samples of [$cucurbits#Plant*] from Idaho with curly top-like symptoms, collected in 2005 and 2007, were confirmed to have the disease.
The susceptibility of [$cucurbits#Plant*] ([$cantaloupe#Plant*], [$honeydew melon#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*], and [$watermelon#Plant*]) to the three curtoviruses known to occur in California ([@Beet curly top virus#Virus*], [@BCTV#Virus*]; [@Beet severe curly top virus#Virus*], [@BSCTV#Virus*]; and [@Beet mild curly top virus#Virus*], [@BMCTV#Virus*]) was evaluated by agroinoculation or leafhopper transmission.
Irrespective of the curtovirus species and inoculation method, low rates of infection and mild or symptomless disease phenotypes were observed in [$cucurbits#Plant*].
In contrast, all inoculated [$tomato#Plant*], [$Nicotiana benthamiana#Plant*], or shepherd's purse plants were infected and developed severe symptoms.
In leafhopper transmission experiments, [$BMCTV#Virus*] infected [$cucurbits#Plant*] when leafhoppers acquired the virus from a symptomatic host with a high viral titer (shepherd's purse), whereas no infection occurred when the acquisition host had mild symptoms and a low viral titer ([$sugar beet#Plant*]); in contrast, the acquisition host did not influence transmission of [$BMCTV#Virus*] to [$tomato#Plant*] or shepherd's purse (all plants were infected).
This revealed an influence of the acquisition host on leafhopper transmission in a host-specific manner.
Our results also indicate that, although [$cucurbits#Plant*] can develop CTD, they are relatively poor hosts for these curtoviruses.
