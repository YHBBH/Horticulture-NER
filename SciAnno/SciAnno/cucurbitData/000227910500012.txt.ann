Control of the [@spider mite#Virus*] [@Tetranychus cinnabarinus Boisduval#Virus*] is problematic, and there is a pressing need for efficient, non-hazardous and inexpensive strategies for limiting the damage it causes.
The gene for the anti-bacterial peptide sarcotoxin IA of the flesh fly Sarcophaga peregrina was cloned into the nonpathogenic [$potyvirus#Virus*]-based vector system [$ZYMV#Virus*]-AGII ([$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*]-AGII).
Expression of this peptide via the AGII vector was detected in infected [$squash #Plant*]leaves and was not deleterious to the host plant.
Leaf discs of [$squash #Plant*]infected with the recombinant virus AGII-sarcotoxin IA were tested for [$spider mite#Virus*] control under laboratory conditions.
[@Spider mite#Virus*] egg production on plants expressing the sarcotoxin IA gene was decreased by a factor of two or three compared with that on AGII-infected plants or healthy leaf discs, respectively.
In contrast to its effect on oviposition, sarcotoxin IA expressing [$squash #Plant*]did not significantly affect the mortality and the ability to re[$pel#Gene*] [$spider mite#Virus*]s.
Crude extract from [$squash #Plant*]leaves infected with AGII-sarcotoxin IA was also found to cause a significant decrease of mite fecundity compared with extracts from AGII-treated or healthy plants and also caused a rise in mite mortality.
Our results demonstrate that sarcotoxin IA affects mite fecundity and, to a lesser degree, mortality, and shows potential for controlling [$spider mite#Virus*]s in the field.
