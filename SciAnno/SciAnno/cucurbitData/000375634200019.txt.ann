In spring 2014, unfamiliar [$watermelon#Plant*] disease symptoms were observed on 1,000 ha of [$watermelon#Plant*] plants ([$Citrullus lanatus Thunb.#Plant*]) growing in open fields in Jordan and Beit-She'an Valleys, Israel.
These represented systemic wilt and yellowing of leaves with necrosis on leaves and stems, in some cases leading to plant dieback, fruit exocarp deterioration, and rotting of the fleshy mesocarp, leading to unmarketable fruit.
[$Virus#Virus*] purification was carried out from [$watermelon#Plant*] exocarp and necrotic leaves, and [$transmission electron microscopy#Method*] revealed viral particles with flexible filamentous morphology.
The disease was transmitted by [$mechanical inoculation#Method*] from symptomatic fruit and by the [$silverleaf whitefly#Virus*] [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*] from symptomatic to healthy [$cucurbits#Plant*].
A [$reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$RT-PCR#Method*]) test was conducted on purified virus preparation of [$Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*]) using specific primers targeting the capsid protein gene revealing the expected amplicon size.
The complete viral genome was sequenced and assembled [@by next-generation sequencing (NGS) Elumina MiSeq of small interfering RNA purified from symptomatic watermelon fruit#Method*], producing 92% genome coverage, and [$RT-PCR#Method*] amplification and Sanger sequencing to close the genome gaps, validating the [@NGS sequence#Method*].
The complete [$SqVYV#Virus*]-IL genome sequence shared 84% nucleotide sequence identity with the two complete genomes of [$SqVYV#Virus*] isolates from Florida, and 91% identity with the deduced amino acid sequence of the viral polyprotein.
