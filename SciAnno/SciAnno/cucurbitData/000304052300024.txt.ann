Gibberellin (GA) signalling during [@pumpkin#Plant*] male flower development is highly regulated, including biosynthetic, perception, and transduction pathways.
GA 20-oxidases, 3-oxidases, and 2-oxidases catalyse the final part of GA synthesis.
Additionally, 7-oxidase initiates this part of the pathway in some [$cucurbits#Plant*] including [@Cucurbita maxima L.#Plant*]
([$pumpkin#Plant*]).
Expression patterns for these GA-oxidase-encoding genes were examined by [@competitive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)#Method*] and endogenous GA levels were determined during [$pumpkin#Plant*] male flower development.
In young flowers, [@GA20ox3#Gene*] transcript levels are high in stamens, followed by high levels of the GA precursor GA(9).
Later, just before flower opening, transcript levels for [@GA3ox3#Gene*] and [@GA3ox4#Gene*] increase in the hypanthium and stamens, respectively.
In the stamen, following [$GA3ox4#Gene*] expression, bioactive GA(4) levels rise dramatically.
Accordingly, catabolic [@GA2ox2#Gene*] and [@GA2ox3#Gene*] transcript levels are low in developing flowers, and increase in mature flowers.
Putative GA receptor GID1b and DELLA repressor GAIPb transcript levels do not change in developing flowers, but increase sharply in mature flowers.
Emasculation arrests floral development completely and leads to abscission of premature flowers.
Application of GA(4) (but not of its precursors GA(12)-aldehyde or GA(9)) restores normal growth of emasculated flowers.
These results indicate that de novo GA(4) synthesis in the stamen is under control of [$GA20ox3#Gene*] and [$GA3ox4#Gene*] genes just before the rapid flower growth phase.
Stamen-derived bioactive GA is essential and sufficient for male flower development, including the petal and the pedicel growth.
