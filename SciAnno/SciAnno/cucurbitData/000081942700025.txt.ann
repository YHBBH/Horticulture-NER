The Plant Genetic Resources Center (CRF-INIA) maintains a seed bank for [@cucurbits#Plant*].
More than 700 accessions of [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] are included and these include important Spanish collections from Valencia and Zaragoza.
In order to avoid problems in seed conservation due to seed-borne fungi, and to minimise/eradicate the risk of dissemination by infected seeds in germplasm exchange, detection of seed-associated fungi has been conducted on this material.
   Twenty-eight acces[$sions#Plant*] of [@C.melo#Plant*] were analysed without any previous treatment.
Two hundred seeds of each accession were tested using [$the Ulster method#Method*] on two culture media; 100 were plated on PDA (general mycological medium) and 100 on Komada medium (selective for [$Fusarium oxysporum#Virus*]).
After incubation, fungal identification was conducted by direct microscopic examination of colonies or slides preparations.
A total of 5600 [$melon#Plant*] seeds were examined.
   Examination of seeds plated on PDA showed the presence of 15 genera of fungi, the highest percentages represented by the following : [@Aspergillus#Virus*] (11%), [@Alternaria #Virus*](7%), [@Rhizopus#Virus*] (6%), [@Cladosporium#Virus*] (3%), [@Stemphylium #Virus*](2%), [@Penicillium #Virus*](2%), [$Fusarium#Virus*] (1%), and [@Helminthosporium#Virus*] (0.6%).
[@F.moniliforme#Virus*] (1.6%), [@F.equiseti#Virus*] (0.9), [@F.solani#Virus*] (0.03) and [$F.oxysporum #Virus*](0.03) were isolated on specific Komada medium.
Most of these fungi are [@saprophytes#Virus*] and are common to different species, but [@F.moniliforme#Virus*] and [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]can be pathogenic, resulting in [$seed rot#Disease*] and death of [$melon#Plant*] [$seedlings#Plant*].
Three times more [$Fusarium spp#Virus*].
colonies were recorded on Komada medium than on PDA.
