Three major factors are involved in the initiation of virus epidemics: the host plant, the vector and the virus.
A combination of many infected susceptible hosts that are attractive to the vector with a high population of the vector is a good prescription for an epidemic.
Changes in agricultural practices can influence these factors, thus starting or preventing future epidemics.
The major viruses affecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Israel in 1960 were [$CMV#Virus*], [$WMV#Virus*]2, and [@CVYV#Virus*].
The major viruses affecting [$cucurbits#Plant*] in Israel today are [$ZYMV#Virus*], [$CYSDV#Virus*], [$CVYV#Method*], and [$CMV#Virus*].
The importance of [@MNSV#Virus*] and [@CGMMV#Virus*] is gradually increasing.
