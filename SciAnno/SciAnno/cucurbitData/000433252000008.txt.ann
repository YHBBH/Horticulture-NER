Sources of resistance to the [$watermelon#Plant*] strain of [$papaya ringspot virus-watermelon strain#Virus*] ([$PRSV-W#Virus*]) have been identified within the [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) germplasm collection.
Inheritance of the resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] was studied in three [$Citrullus amarus#Plant*] (formerly [$C.lanatus var.citroides#Plant*]) PI accessions: PI 244017, PI 244019, and PI 485583.
Three susceptible parent lines, 'Allsweet', 'Calhoun Gray', and 'New Hampshire Midget', were crossed with resistant PI accessions to develop F-1, F-2, and BC1 progenies in six families.
A single recessive gene was found to control the resistance to [$PRSV-W#Virus*] in all three resistant PI accessions.
Allelism tests indicated that the three PI accessions carry the same resistance allele to [$PRSV-W#Virus*].
The gene symbol 'prv' is proposed for [$PRSV-W#Virus*] resistance in PI 244017, PI 244019, and PI 485583 in [$watermelon#Plant*].
