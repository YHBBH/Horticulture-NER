Rotting [$muskmelon#Plant*] fruits commonly are associated with commercial fields that are affected by the [$root rot#Disease*]/[@vine decline disease#Disease*] syndrome found in southern Texas.
Four isolates of [$Fusarium solani#Virus*] previously shown to be either weakly pathogenic or nonpathogenic to [$muskmelon seedlings#Plant*] caused extensive rot on mechanically wounded [$muskmelon#Plant*] fruits.
Two of these isolates caused more extensive fruit rot than either [$F.solani#Virus*] (Mart.) Sacc.f.sp.[$cucurbitae#Plant*] W.C.Snyder & H.N.Hans.
or [$F.oxysporum #Virus*]Schlechtend.:Fr.[$melon#Plant*]is (Leach & Currence) W.C.Snyder & H.N.Hans., causal agents of fusarium crown and foot rot of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and fusarium wilt of [$muskmelon#Plant*], respectively.
In other tests, root-dip inoculation of [$seedlings#Plant*] showed that all [$muskmelon#Plant*] cultigens included in this study and the breeding line MR-1 were susceptible to a California and an Arkansas strain of [@F.s.f.sp.cucurbitae race 1#Virus*].
