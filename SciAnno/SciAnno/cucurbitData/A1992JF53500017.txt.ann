The causal agent of an unusual disease affecting [$watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus#Plant*]) in Taiwan was identified as tomato spotted wilt-like virus in the [$tospovirus#Virus*] group on the basis of particle morphology, host reactions, serology, and transmission by thrips.
 Host symptoms included leaf crinkling, mottling, yellow spotting, short internodes, upright growth of younger branches, and tip necrosis.
 The systemic infection of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and transmissibility by the vector Thrips palmi distinguished this isolate from most other [@tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$TSWV#Virus*]) isolates.
 [$Serological tests#Method*] by [$enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay#Method*] and [$western blotting#Method*] with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that the [@watermelon virus#Virus*] is serologically related to the [$TSWV#Virus*] that causes silver mottle on [$watermelon#Plant*] in Okinawa (Japan) and not to the [$tomato#Plant*], [$lettuce#Plant*], and amaryllis isolates of [$TSWV#Virus*] from other countries.
