Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on nucleotide sequences corresponding to the conserved phosphate 1 and 2 motifs contained within the closterovirus-encoded [@heat shock protei 70 #Gene*]([$HSP70#Gene*]) homolog.
These primers were used with RNAs extracted from virus-infected plants and reverse-transcriptase [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] to generate specific cDNAs for [@lettuce infectious yellows closterovirus#Virus*] ([$LIYV#Virus*]) and for four additional [$whitefly-transmitted viruses#Virus*] for which corresponding nucleotide sequence data were unavailable: [@tomato infectious chlorosis virus#Virus*] ([$TICV#Virus*]), [$cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), [$beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]), and [@lettuce chlorosis virus#Virus*].
The resulting cDNAs of approximately 600 bp, corresponding to [$LIYV#Virus*], [$TICV#Virus*], [$CYSDV#Virus*], and [$BPYV#Virus*], were cloned, and the nucleotide sequences were determined.
[@Computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences#Method*] showed that all exhibited significant similarity to the [$HSP70#Gene*] proteins in general and to the [$HSP70#Gene*] homologs encoded by closteroviruses in particular.
Comparative alignments showed the amino acid sequences for [$LIYV#Virus*], [$TICV#Virus*], [$BPYV#Virus*], and [$CYSDV#Virus*] were more similar to each other than to the corresponding regions for the [$HSP70#Gene*] homologs of three [@aphid-transmitted closteroviruses#Virus*].
Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled transcripts were generated from each cloned cDNA and used in RNA and dot blot hybridization analyses.
Probes for [$LIYV#Virus*], [$TICV#Virus*], [$BPYV#Virus*], and [$CYSDV#Virus*] hybridized only with double-stranded RNAs or extracts of plants infected with the corresponding virus.
