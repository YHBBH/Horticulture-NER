The methanolic extract from the roots of Wilbrandia ebracteata afforded, in addition to the known dihydrocucurbitacins B and E, dihydroisocucurbitacin B, cucurbitacins B, D, E, G, H, P, and 22-deoxycucurbitacin D, four new compounds whose structures were elucidated as (20R,24xi)-3beta,16alpha,20,24,25-pentahydro-xy-10alpha-cucurbit-5-ene-2,11,22-trione (3-epi-isocucurbitacin G) (8), (20R,22xi)-2beta,16alpha,20,22,25-pentahydro-xy-10alpha-cucurbita-5,23t-diene-3,11-dione (13), (20R)-25-acetoxy-3,16a,20-trihydroxy-30-nor-2-(beta-D-glucopy-ranosyloxy)-1,2,3,4,5, 10-dehydrocucurbit-6-ene-11,22-dione (14), and dihydroisocucurbitacin B-3-glucoside (16).
