A serious vine decline of [@cucurbits#Plant*] known as [$cucurbit#Plant*] [$yellow vine disease#Disease*] ([$CYVD#Disease*]) is caused by [@rod-shaped bacteria#Virus*] that colonize the phloem elements.
[$Sequence analysis#Method*] of a [$CYVD#Disease*]-specific [$polymerase chain reaction#Method*] ([$PCR#Method*])-amplified 16S rDNA product showed the microbe to be a gamma-proteobacterium related to the [@genus Serratia#Virus*].
To identify and characterize the bacteria, one strain each from [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$zucchini#Plant*] and several noncucurbit-derived reference strains were subjected to [$sequence analysis#Method*] and [@biological function assays#Method*].
[@Taxonomic and phylogenetic placement#Method*] was investigated by analysis of the groE and 16S rDNA regions, which were amplified by [$PCR#Method*] and directly sequenced.
For comparison, eight other bacterial strains, identified by others as [@Serratia spp#Virus*].
also were sequenced.
These sequences clearly identified the [$CYVD#Disease*] strains as [$Serratia marcescens#Virus*].
However, evaluation of metabolic and biochemical features revealed that [$cucurbit#Plant*]-derived strains of [$S.marcescens#Virus*] differ substantially from strains of the same species isolated from other environmental niches.
[$Cucurbit#Plant*] strains formed a distinct cluster, separate from other strains, when their fatty acid methyl ester profiles were analyzed.
In substrate utilization assays (BIOLOG, Vitek, and API 20E), the [$CYVD#Disease*] strains lacked a number of metabolic functions characteristic for [$S.marcescens#Virus*], failing to catabolize 25 to 30 compounds; that were utilized by [$S.marcescens#Virus*] reference strains.
These biological differences may reflect gene loss or repression that Occurred as the bacterium adapted to life as an intracellular parasite and plant [$pathogen#Virus*].
