Among the reported [@begomoviruses#Virus*] which cause [@tomato leaf curl disease#Disease*] ([@TLCD#Disease*]) in Iran, [@Tomato leaf curl Palampur virus#Virus*] ([@ToLCPMV#Virus*]) was the first bipartite [$begomovirus#Virus*] to be detected in [$tomato#Plant*] in 2006 in Hormozgan Province (southern Iran).
Following this, the [$ToLCPMV#Virus*] incidence has progressively increased amongst several cultivated plants and to new geographical regions within Iran.
We detected [$ToLCPMV#Virus*] by [$PCR#Method*] in six [$crop#Plant*] species-[$tomato#Plant*], [$cucumber#Plant*], three different local cultivars of [$melon#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$bean#Plant*] in commercial greenhouses, plastic tunnels and/or open farms.
[$Squash#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*], [$bean#Plant*] and two [$weed#Plant*] species, [@Chenopodium sp.#Plant*]
and [@Heliotropium europaeum#Plant*], represent new natural hosts of ToLPMV globally.
The [$ToLCPMV#Virus*] epidemic has been particularly devastating on [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], and [$squash #Plant*][$crops#Plant*].
Infections rates of between 50 and 100 % were identified amongst greenhouse grown [$cucumbers#Plant*] and[$ melons#Plant*] farms.
However, the rate of infection in [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$bean#Plant*] were negligible.
Full-length genome characterization of ten [$ToLCPMV#Virus*] isolates from [$cucumber#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$bean#Plant*] showed a minimum 95 % sequence identity with previously characterized [$ToLCPMV#Virus*] isolates (DNA-A).
The movement of [$ToLCPMV#Virus*] from south-eastern Iran to south, northeast and central regions with warm climatic conditions threatens the cultivation of [$cucurbits#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] in these regions, which are the major production areas for these [$crops#Plant*].
