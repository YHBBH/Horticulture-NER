During surveys carried out in June and October 2005 and August 2006 for assessing the occurrence of [@cucurbit-infecting viruses#Virus*] in Tunisia, samples of [$squash#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*] and [$snake cucumber#Plant*] showing virus-like symptoms were collected from the major [$cucurbit#Plant*]-growing areas.
Besides mosaic-inducing viruses, [$DAS-ELISA#Method*] and [@RT-PCR tests#Method*] showed the presence of yellows-inducing viruses: [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*], [@Polerovirus#Virus*]), [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*], [$Crinivirus#Virus*]) and [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*], [@Ipomovirus#Virus*]).
While [$CABYV#Virus*], a virus previously reported from Tunisia, was detected throughout the country, [$CYSDV#Virus*] and [@CVyV#Virus*], reported here for the first time, were found only in the Sahel and the Southern part of the country.
The identification of [$CYSDV#Virus*] and [$CVYV#Virus*] was confirmed by immunosorbent electron microscopy.
[$Phylogenetic analysis#Method*] done on parts of the [$CP#Gene*] gene sequence showed that Tunisian [$CYSDV#Virus*] isolates have high sequence identity (99-100%) with isolates that have recently emerged in the Middle East, Southern Europe and the United States.
In contrast, [$CVYV#Virus*] isolates from Tunisia are more divergent (96.6%) from Middle East isolates and are only distantly related (94.5-95%) to isolates which recently emerged in Spain, Portugal and France.
