[@Downy mildew#Disease*], caused by [@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*], is a severe foliar disease of many [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide.
Forty-one [$cucurbit #Plant*]cultigens (commercial cultivars and plant introductions) from five genera ([$Cucumis#Plant*], [$Citrullus#Plant*],[$ Cucurbita#Plant*], [$Lagenaria#Plant*], and [$Luffa#Plant*]) were assessed for susceptibility to [$P.cubensis #Virus*]in a research field exposed to natural inoculum in Michigan.
Eight cultigens from a differential set for pathotype determination were included within the 41 cultigens to detect changes in dominant [$P.cubensis #Virus*]pathotypes present.
No pathotype differences were found between 2010 and 2011.
[$Cucumis melo#Plant*] cultigen MR-1 was less susceptible to Michigan [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations than other [$C.melo#Plant*] cultigens.
No symptoms or signs of [$infe#Method*]ction were detected on cultigens of [@Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] and [$C.pepo#Plant*].
Disease onset was later in 2011 than 2010; greater than 90% disease severity in pickling [$cucumber#Plant*] 'Vlaspik' was observed in both years.
This study confirmed that [$Cucumis#Plant*] is the most susceptible [$cucurbit #Plant*]genus, while [$Citrullus#Plant*] and[$ Cucurbita#Plant*] cultigens were the least susceptible genera to populations of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]in Michigan.
Area under the disease progress curve values indicated that disease progress was limited on all [$Citrullus#Plant*] cultigens compared with [$Cucumis#Plant*] cultigens, and [$pathogen#Virus*] sporulation was not detected under field conditions.
Future studies should evaluate the ability of a reduced fungicide program to control [$downy mildew#Virus*] on less susceptible [$Cucumis melo#Plant*] 'Edisto 47', 'Primo', 'Athena', 'Strike', 'Ananas', 'Banana', and 'Tam-Dew'.
Many of the [$melon cultivars#Plant*] evaluated were selected on the basis of reported resistance to [$downy mildew#Virus*], yet they showed significant disease symptoms.
It is important to evaluate candidate cultigens for resistance to local [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations.
