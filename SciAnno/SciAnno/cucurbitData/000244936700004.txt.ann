Autotoxicity including population deterioration, regeneration failure and subsequent yield declines, are commonly observed in [@rice#Plant*] ([$Oryza sativa#Plant*]), [$tomato#Plant*] ([$Lycopersicon esculentum#Plant*]), [$cucumber#Plant*] ([$Cucumis sativus#Plant*]), other [$Cucurbit crops#Plant*], [$tea tree#Plant*] ([$Camellia sinensis#Plant*]), [$horsetail wood#Plant*] ([@Casuarina equisetifolia#Plant*]) and [@Chinese fir#Plant*] ([@Cunninghamia lanceolata#Plant*]), in Southern China.
This article reviews the researches done on autotoxins, mechanisms involved, ecological implications and management strategies in Southern China.
