Twenty-one land races of [@Cucumis melo#Plant*] from several regions of Greece were scored for morphological characteristics (sex expression, fruit shape, immature fruit color, mature fruit color, fruit ribs, fruit hair, fruit netting) and for [$powdery mildew#Disease*] resistance.
[@Assessment of powdery mildew reaction of the entries#Method*] was made in comparison with the resistance reaction of several populations of known resistance and differential lines for races of [$Sphaerotheca fuliginea#Virus*].
Differences were observed among acces[$sions#Plant*] for ail characteristics.
A high level of [$powdery mildew#Disease*] resistance was found in plants of four accessions.
The comparative assessment of twelve populations of known resistance and nine differentials is indicative of the presence of race 1 and probably race 2 of the [@pathogen#Virus*].
