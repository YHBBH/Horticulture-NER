The [@striped cucumber beetle#Virus*] ([@Acalymma vittatum (F.)#Virus*]) is a destructive pest of [$cucurbit crops#Plant*], and management could be improved by host plant resistance, especially in organic farming systems.
However, despite the variation in [$striped cucumber beetle#Virus*] preference observed within the economically important species, [@Cucurbita pepo L.#Plant*], plant breeders and entomologists lacked a simple framework to classify and exploit these differences.
This study used recent phylogenetic evidence and bioassays to organize [$striped cucumber beetle#Virus*] preference within [$C.pepo#Plant*].
Our results indicate preference contrasts between the two agriculturally relevant subspecies: [$C.pepo subsp.texana#Plant*] and [@C.pepo subsp.pepo#Plant*].
Plants of [$C.pepo subsp.pepo#Plant*] were more strongly preferred than [$C.pepo subsp.texana#Plant*] plants.
This structure of beetle preference in [$C.pepo#Plant*] will allow plant breeders and entomologists to better focus research efforts on host plant non-preference to control [$striped cucumber beetle#Virus*]s.
