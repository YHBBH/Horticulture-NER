In the study hami [@melon#Plant*] cultivar `Xizhoumi No.
25' was grafted onto 23 different types of [$cucurbit #Plant*][$rootstocks#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*], [$C.pepo#Plant*], [$C.maxima#Plant*] x [$C.moschata#Plant*], and [$Cucumis melo#Plant*]) and the self-grafted [$melon#Plant*] anvil, to study the compatibility of different rootstocks, and the effect of grafting on [$melon#Plant*] yield and quality.
In terms of compatibility, [$C.maxima#Plant*] x [$C.moschata#Plant*] F1 was better than the [$melon#Plant*]-self anvil, [$C.moschata#Plant*], and [$C.pepo#Plant*] compared with the self-rooted control.
The differences in fruit quality and yield of grafted plants were non-significant, only few grafted cultivars slightly improved fruit quality and yield.
The self-rooted plants presented good fruit characteristics, whereas grafted plants were affected although performance varied among the treatments.
Based on graft compatibility, yield, and fruit quality assessment results, we concluded that `Jiachenzhen No.
2' (S38), `Jinanchangqingteng' (S27), `Syngenta BN224' (S30), and `Jiuquandabaizi' (S35) showed better performances than other rootstocks, whereas [$C.maxima#Plant*], `Nangua No.
1', [$C.moschata#Plant*], ` Huofenghuang' (S25), and `Zhuangshi' (S31) proved to be inferior and these rootstock are not recommended for `Xizhoumi No.
25'.
