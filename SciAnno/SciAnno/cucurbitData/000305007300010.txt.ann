During 2010, yellowing symptoms were frequently observed in cultivated squash fields in Egypt.
A total of 717 symptomatic [@squash#Plant*] leaf samples were collected from four regions where [$squash #Plant*]cultivation is of economic importance for the country: Kafrelsheikh, El-Behira, El-Sharkia and El-Ismailia.
Serological analysis showed that 95.6% of the symptomatic [$squash #Plant*]samples were infected by [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), and visual estimation of the incidence of yellowing symptoms suggested a very high incidence of [$CABYV#Virus*] in the fields.
Twelve [$CABYV#Virus*] isolates were characterized by sequencing two regions of the viral genome, open reading frame (ORF) 3 and ORFs 4/5.
Overall, Egyptian isolates were very similar among them, and had higher similarity values with a French than with a Chinese isolate.
The average nucleotide diversity for ORF 3 was significantly higher than for the other two regions, indicating that variability is not evenly distributed along the viral genome.
The ratios between nucleotide diversity values in non-synonymous (d(N)) and synonymous (d(S)) positions (d(N)/d(S)) for each ORF showed that the three ORFs are evolving under different pressures, although predominantly under purifying selection.
[$Phylogenetic analyses#Method*] revealed that these Egyptian isolates, with only one exception, shared the same clade with a French isolate.
Moreover, these analyses suggested that Egyptian isolates belong to the Mediterranean group described previously.
