[@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] is one of the most devastating diseases of [$cucurbitaceous crops#Plant*].
The [$pathogen#Virus*] has a worldwide distribution and occurs in all major [$cucurbit #Plant*]growing areas.
It had been noticed for the first time at the end of the 19th century, but it became a globally severe disease as recently as 1984 in Europe and 2004 in North America.
Despite its economic importance, species concepts in [$Pseudoperonospora#Virus*] are debated.
Here, we report that the genus [$Pseudoperonospora#Virus*] contains cryptic species distinct from the currently accepted ones.
[$Pseudoperonospora#Virus*] on Celtis is split into two phylogenetic lineages and [@Pseudoperonospora humuli#Virus*] is confirmed as a species distinct from the[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae-infecting lineages.
A cryptic species occupying a basal position within the [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] complex is revealed to be present on Humulus japonicus, thus providing evidence that the host jump that gave rise to [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] likely occurred from hops.
Notably, [@Cucurbitaceae#Plant*] infecting [$pathogens#Virus*] are present in two cryptic sister species or subspecies.
Clade 1 contains primarily specimens from North America and likely represents [$Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] s.str., Pre-epidemic isolates in clade 2 originate from Japan and Korea, suggesting this cryptic species or subspecies is indigenous to East Asia.
Recent samples of this lineage from epidemics in Europe and the United States cluster together with clade 2.
It thus seems possible that this lineage is associated with the recent severe epidemics of [$cucurbit downy mildew#Disease*] and is now naturalised in North America and Europe.
