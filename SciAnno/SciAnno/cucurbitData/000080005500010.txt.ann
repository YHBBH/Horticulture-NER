The relative occurrence in Spain of two [@whitefly#Virus*] transmitted closteroviruses causing similar yellowing diseases in [@melon#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*] greenhouse [$crops#Plant*] was studied.
Based on a [@RT- PCR assay#Method*], a 1994-1997 survey of Spanish greenhouses showed that the recently described [$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]-transmitted [$cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]) has displaced the [$Trialeurodes vaporariorum#Virus*]-transmitted [$beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]), a virus that was present in the area since the late 1970s.
The [$CYSDV#Virus*] transmission rates by each of the two biotypes of B.
tabaci present in Spain were compared.
The results showed that the ubiquitous 'B' biotype and the resident 'Q' biotype (found in Spain and Portugal) were able to transmit [$CYSDV#Virus*] with similar efficiency.
