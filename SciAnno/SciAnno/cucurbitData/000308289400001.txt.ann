[@Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] is the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch#Disease*] ([$BFB#Disease*]) of [$cucurbit plants#Plant*].
In recent years, the disease has spread to many parts of the world, mainly via the inadvertent distribution of contaminated commercial seeds.
Because of the costly lawsuits filed by growers against seed companies and the lack of efficient [$management methods#Method*], [$BFB#Disease*] represents a serious threat to the [$cucurbit #Plant*]industry, and primarily to [$watermelons#Plant*] and[$ melons#Plant*].
Despite the economic importance of the disease, little is known about the basic aspects of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]pathogenesis.
Nevertheless, the release of the genome of one [@A.citrulli#Virus*] strain, as well as the optimization of molecular manipulation and inoculation methods, has prompted basic studies and allowed advances towards an understanding of [$A.citrulli #Virus*]pathogenicity.
In this article, we summarize the current knowledge about this important [$pathogen#Virus*], with emphasis on its [$epidemiology#Method*] and the factors involved in its [$pathogenicity#Plant*] and virulence.
Taxonomy Bacteria; [@Betaproteobacteria#Virus*]; [@order Burkholderiales#Virus*]; [@family C omamonadaceae#Virus*]; [@genus Acidovorax#Virus*]; [@species citrulli#Virus*].
Microbiological properties Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped; average dimensions of 0.5?mu m X 1.7?mu m; motile by means of an similar to 5.0-mu m-long polar flagellum; colonies on King's medium B are round, smooth, transparent and nonpigmented; optimal temperatures for growth around 2730?degrees C; induces a hypersensitive response on nonhost [$tobacco#Plant*] and [$tomato#Plant*] leaves.
Host range [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*] strains are pathogenic to various species of the [@Cucurbitaceae family#Plant*], including [$watermelon#Plant*], [$melon#Plant*], [$squash#Plant*], [$pumpkin#Plant*] and [$cucumber#Plant*].
Significant economic losses have been reported in [$watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon#Plant*].
Disease symptoms [$Watermelon#Plant*] and [$melon seedlings#Plant*] and fruits are highly susceptible to [$A.citrulli#Virus*].
Typical seedling symptoms include water-soaked lesions on cotyledons that are often adjacent to the veins and later become necrotic, lesions on the hypocotyl, and seedling collapse and death.
On [$watermelon#Plant*] fruits, symptoms begin as small, irregular, water-soaked lesions which later extend through the rind, turn brown and crack.
On [$melon#Plant*] fruits, symptoms are characterized by small, often sunken rind lesions and internal fruit decay.
Symptoms on the leaves of [$mature plants#Plant*] are difficult to diagnose because they are often inconspicuous or similar to those caused by other biotic or abiotic stresses.
When they occur, leaf lesions can spread along the midrib and main veins.
Lesions appear dark-brown to black on [$watermelon#Plant*] and light to reddish-brown on [$melon#Plant*].
