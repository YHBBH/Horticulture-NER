[@Citron watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus var.citroides#Plant*]) is an important tropical [$crop#Plant*] belonging to the [@Cucurbitaceae family#Plant*].
It possesses novel[$ gene#Method*]s for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and horticultural traits useful for breeding including [$sweet#Plant*] dessert [$watermelon#Plant*].
There is a lack of research priority limiting the genetic improvement and cultivar deployment of [$citron#Plant*] [$watermelon#Plant*].
Genetically diverse [@citron watermelon#Plant*] genetic resources are important to identify and select suitable genotypes for cultivar development incorporating horticultural attributes according to the needs and preferences of clients and marketplace.
The objective of this review was to present progress on genetic improvement of [$citron watermelon#Plant*] with emphasis on cultivar development with biotic and abiotic stress resistance and desired horticultural attributes.
Further, the review highlighted genetic and molecular resources in [@citron watermelon#Plant*] and other cross compatible [$cucurbits#Plant*] that may aid in accelerated breeding and cultivar release.
Finally, the paper summarized research focus areas with potential to enhance effective utilization of [$citron watermelon#Plant*] genetic resources for targeted breeding of this [$crop#Plant*] or related taxa such as dessert [$watermelon#Plant*].
