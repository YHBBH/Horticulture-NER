Leaf samples of[$ Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] with [@yellow mosaic disease symptoms#Disease*] were collected in 2012.
Rolling circle amplification and [$PCR#Method*] amplification with [$begomovirus#Virus*]-specific primers confirmed the presence of an Old World bipartite [$begomovirus#Virus*], an alphasatellite and a betasatellite.
Mo[$lecul#Virus*]ar analysis of full-length sequences showed that [$Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus#Virus*] (DNA-A) is associated with its cognate DNA-B, Papaya leaf curl betasatellite and a novel alphasatellite.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an alphasatellite and a betasatellite associated with a bipartite [$begomovirus#Virus*].
