 Transparent polyethylene mulch was tested for its efficacy in reducing insect populations, virus diseases, and increasing soil temperature and yield of cantaloup ([$Cucumis melo L.#Plant*]) in a tropical region.
Transparent mulch reduced [$whitefly#Virus*] populations, aphids caught in yellow traps, and virus incidence, with respect to bare soil (control).
Also, soil temperatures in the morning, midday, and afternoon were significantly increased in the transparent mulch.
Cantaloup fruit yield was positively influenced by the mulched plot.
The export- and national-quality fruit yield was 11-fold and two-fold higher, respectively in the mulched plot in relation to control.
Total yield in the transparent mulch was 31.2 t/ha, whereas that in bare soil was 6.9 t.
