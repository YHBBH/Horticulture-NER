A greenhouse trial was used to evaluate 159 accessions of [$bottle gourd#Plant*] [[$Lagenaria siceraria (Mol.) Standl.#Plant*]] obtained from the U.S.
National Plant Germplasm for tolerance to clomazone herbicide.
Most accessions tested were moderately or severely injured by clomazone at 3.0 mg.kg(-1) incorporated into greenhouse potting medium; however, several exhibited lower injury.
Seeds were produced from tolerant and susceptible plants for use in a greenhouse concentration-response experiment.
About three to four times higher clomazone concentrations were required to cause moderate injury to tolerant bottle genotypes in comparison with susceptible genotypes.
The differences in tolerance among genotypes were observed with injury ratings, chlorophyll measurements, and shoot weights.
Clomazone may be used safely on tolerant [$bottle gourd#Plant*] genotypes, but the herbicide may not be safe for susceptible genotypes.
Also, tolerant genotypes such as Grif 11942 may be desirable for use as rootstocksPlant*] in grafted [$watermelon#Plant*] production.
