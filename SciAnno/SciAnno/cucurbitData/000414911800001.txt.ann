[@Watermelon#Plant*] ([@Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum.& Nakai var.lanatus#Plant*]) is an economically important [$crop#Plant*] in South Korea.
Although efforts have been made to develop disease-resistant cultivars, defense signal pathways in [$watermelon#Plant*] are still unknown.
GNK2 domain containing proteins in plants are involved in oxidative stress and salt stress, and in defense signaling responses to [$pathogens#Virus*] and viruses.
[$Arabidopsis thaliana#Plant*][@ plasmodesmata-located protein 5 (PDLP5)#Gene*] controls cell-to-cell communication and defense signaling.
We identified five [$Arabidopsis#Plant*] [@PDLP5#Gene*] ([@AtPDLP5#Gene*]) homologous in [$watermelon#Plant*], using the [$Cucurbit#Plant*] Genomics Database.
The five putative [$watermelon#Plant*] [@PDLPs#Gene*] had two GNK2 domains and showed high sequence identities to [$AtPDLP5#Gene*].
Their mRNAs were expressed in three [$watermelon cultivars#Plant*], PI189225, Au-Producer, and 920533.
Each mRNA was differently expressed after infection of [$Colletotrichum orbiculare#Virus*], [$Didymella bryoniae#Virus*], and [@Pseudomonas syringae#Virus*].
In addition to [$pathogen#Virus*] infection, their expression patterns were altered when subjected to abiotic stresses (drought, salt, and cold) or salicylic acid treatment.
Cla006974 mRNA was absent in the 920533 cultivar infected with [$D.bryoniae#Virus*].
Based on these findings, we propose that five putative [$watermelon#Plant*] [$PDLPs#Gene*] are involved in defense against [$fungal pathogens#Virus*] and abiotic stresses.
In addition, Cla006974 could be useful as a marker for selecting [$Gummy stem blight#Disease*]-resistant cultivars via molecular screening.
