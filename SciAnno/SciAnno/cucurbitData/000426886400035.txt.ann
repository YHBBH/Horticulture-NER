[@Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus#Virus*] ([$ToLCNDV#Virus*]) ([$family Geminiviridae#Virus*], [@genus Begomovirus#Virus*]) is an important [$pathogen#Virus*] that severely affects [$tomato#Plant*] and [$cucurbits#Plant*] production.
Original from the Indian Subcontinent, it has been recently introduced in Spain causing severe epidemics in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*].
[$ToLCNDV#Virus*] genome consists of two single-stranded circular DNA molecules, denominated DNA-A and DNA-B, of approximately 2.7 kb each.
Partial dimeric DNA-A and DNA-B clones were constructed in a binary vector and used to agroinoculate [$zucchini#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita pepo#Plant*] 'Brillante') and [$pumpkin#Plant*] ([$Cucurbita moschata#Plant*] 'Avalon F1') plants.
Symptoms were observed in plants of both species at 100 and 50% frequency for [$zucchini#Plant*] and [$pumpkin#Plant*] plants, respectively.
First symptoms appeared 7 days post-inoculation, and they were clearly observed at 14 days post-inoculation.
Visual observation was confirmed by [@molecular techniques#Method*], such as [$molecular hybridization#Method*] and q[$PCR#Method*].
This new [$ToLCNDV#Virus*] [$infe#Plant*]ctious clone, based on a Spanish isolate, constitutes a useful tool for basic and applied virology studies.
