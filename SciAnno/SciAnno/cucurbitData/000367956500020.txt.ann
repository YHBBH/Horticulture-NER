[@Pseudoperonospora cubensis#Virus*] is an oomycete [$pathogen#Virus*] causing [$downy mildew disease#Disease*] on a variety of[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae, and has recently re-emerged as a destructive disease on [$crops#Plant*] in this family, mainly on [$cucumber#Plant*] and [$squash#Plant*].
Multilocus [$sequence analysis#Method*] ([@MLSA#Method*]) of four mitochondrial and two nuclear DNA regions was used to detect changes in the genetic structure of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations occurring in the Czech Republic that might be associated with recently reported shifts in virulence.
The analysed sample set contains 67 [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates collected from 1995 to 2012 in the Czech Republic and some other European countries.
Sequence analyses revealed differences and changes in the genetic backgrounds of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]isolates.
While all isolates sampled before 2009 exhibited the genotype of the subspecies of Clade II and were collected from [$cucumber#Plant*], all samples collected from other hosts belonged to Clade I ([@P.cubensis sensu stricto#Virus*]) or were sampled from 2009 onwards.
In addition, 67.16% of all post-2009 isolates from Clade II had two heterozygous positions in their nrITS sequence, which suggests sexual reproduction and/or a mutational origin.
Thus, the results indicate that, apart from the rise in prevalence of Clade I, the change in the genetic structure of [$P.cubensis #Virus*]populations may be linked with a hybridization or, less likely, a mutation event that rendered strains able to infect a broader spectrum of host species.
