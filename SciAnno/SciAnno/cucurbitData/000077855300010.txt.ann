DNA polymorphism among [@Cucumis melo#Plant*] accessions was assessed using [$RFLPs#Gene*] and [@RAPDs#Gene*].
Thirteen varieties that represent diverse [$melon#Plant*]-types were sun eyed using 18 RAPD primers.
[@Cluster analysis#Method*] indicated that the largest divergence among [$melon#Plant*]-types occurred between [@C.melo var.momordica#Plant*] from India and the North American and European [$muskmelon#Plant*] cultivars.
The latter were also well-diverged from vars.
conomon, chito and dudaim from the Far East and var, agrestis from Africa.
Dessert [$melon#Plant*] varieties belonging to var.
indorus and cantalupensis, respectively, were not differentiated in this analysis, indicating that most of the genetic variation in the [$melon#Plant*] germplasm should be sought among land-races and wild accessions.
As many as 61% of the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers produced polymorphic patterns between the two varieties Topmark (var, cantalupensis) and P.I.
413723 (var.
momordica), indicating that [$RAPDs#Gene*] reveal abundant polymorphism in [$melons#Plant*].
A subset of eight varieties was assayed with RFLP probes, either genomic PstI-clones, or [$cucumber#Plant*] floral bud-cDNAs.
Of the 56 probes surveyed with six restriction enzymes, about 80% detected polymorphism among the eight accessions.
It turned out that the [$melon#Plant*] genome contains abundant PstI-digested repetitive sequences, and that EcoRI was the most productive restriction enzyme in detecting polymorphism.
The efficient use of [$cucumber#Plant*] cDNAs for [$melon#Plant*] genome analysis suggests that the comparative mapping of these two important [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] may be possible.
