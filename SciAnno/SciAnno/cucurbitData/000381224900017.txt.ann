More than 50 viruses have been reported in [$cucurbit crops#Plant*] worldwide.
In Argentina, [$cucurbit viruses #Virus*]have been associated with important yield losses.
The most prevalent and widespread [$potyvirus#Virus*] is [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]).
[$WMV#Virus*] was detected in Argentina in all [$cucurbit species #Plant*]with high incidence.
In this study, a [$WMV#Virus*] isolate ([$WMV#Virus*] 1 SDE FF) was obtained from a naturally infected [$squash #Plant*]associated with a severe outbreak on [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*][$crops#Plant*] in an important [$cucurbit #Plant*]growing area in Santiago del Estero province (Argentina), during a survey conducted in November 2012.
The fully sequenced [$WMV#Virus*] 1 SDE FF genome consists of 10,027 nucleotides and shares 96 % nt identity and 98 % aa identity with the French isolates JF273464.1|C07-014 and EU660581.1|FMF00-LL1 of the [$WMV#Virus*] molecular group 3.
Using the recombination detection program RDP4, two statistically significant recombination events were identified: event 1, an 830-nt long recombinant fragment in the putative P1 coding region, and event 2, a 4071-nt recombinant fragment detected across the HC Pro, P3 and CI coding regions.
The putative parental sequences detected for event 1 were the EU660586.1| FBR04-37 (major parent) and JF273468.1|C07-284 (minor parent), both from France.
Putative parental sequences for event 2 were JX079685.1| [$WMV#Virus*]-ShanXi (major parent) and HQ384216.1|Dendrobium (minor parent), from China and USA, respectively.
To our knowledge, this is the first complete genome of an Argentine [$WMV#Virus*] isolate.
Our results provide evidence that [$WMV#Virus*] 1 SDE FF is the causal agent of the strong outbreak reported in [$melon#Plant*] and [$squash #Plant*]fields in recent years.
