[@Watermelon vine decline#Disease*] ([$WVD#Disease*]) is an emerging threat to [$watermelon#Plant*] production in southwest and west-central Florida.
Losses in 2004-2005 due to [$WVD#Disease*] were estimated to be more than 60 million US dollars.
The disease is caused by [$Squash vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$SqVYV#Virus*], family: [$Potyviridae#Virus*], genus: [$Ipomovirus#Virus*]) and is transmitted by [$whiteflies#Virus*] ([$Bemisia tabaci#Virus*]).
[$SqVYV#Virus*] is a close relative of, but distinct from, another [$cucurbit#Plant*]-infecting ipomovirus, [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]), that has been reported from most countries in the Mediterranean Basin since it was first described in Israel in the 1960s.
Symptoms of [$WVD#Disease*] typically include a sudden [$decline#Disease*] and death of [$vines#Plant*] at or just prior to harvest.
Fruit symptoms include internal flesh degradation and necrosis of the fruit rind.
So far, only [$cucurbits#Plant*] have been confirmed as hosts for [$SqVYV#Virus*], and striking symptoms of [$vine decline#Disease*] in agricultural production have been observed only on [$watermelon#Plant*].
[$Balsam-apple#Plant*] ([$Momordica charantia#Plant*]), a [$cucurbit #Plant*][$weed#Plant*] that is widely distributed in Florida, was found to be a common reservoir host for [$SqVYV#Virus*].
Management of [$whitefly#Virus*] populations using insecticides was shown to reduce [$WVD#Disease*] development and incidence of fruit symptoms.
Sources of resistance to [$SqVYV#Virus*] have been identified, and resistant germplasm resources are being developed.
Present recommendations for managing [$WVD#Disease*] include management of [$whitefly#Virus*] populations, removal of [$SqVYV#Virus*] reservoir hosts, and [$crop#Plant*] destruction soon after harvest.
This manuscript will review the progress and challenges in dealing with [$WVD#Disease*] since it first appeared in Florida in 2003, and compare and contrast it with [$CVYV#Virus*].
