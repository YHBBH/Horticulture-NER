[@Tasmanian vegetable crops#Plant*] ([$broccoli#Plant*], [$carrots#Plant*], [$cauliflower#Plant*], [$common bean#Plant*], and [$pea#Plant*]) were tested for virus infection with [@Potyviruses#Virus*] (all [$crops#Plant*]), members of the [@Luteoviridae#Virus*] (all except [$carrot#Plant*]), [@Alfalfa mosaic virus#Virus*] (all except [$brassicas#Plant*]), [$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] (all except [$carrot#Plant*] and [$cauliflower#Plant*]), [@Subterranean clover stunt virus#Virus*] ([$legumes#Plant*] only), [$Tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$legumes#Plant*] only) and [@Cauliflower mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$brassicas#Plant*] only) over three seasons (2007-2010).
Low (and sporadic) incidence of each virus (or virus group) was found in [$pea#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
Only Luteovirid and SCSV infections were found in [$bean#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] at low frequency and incidence.
Virus infection was not detected in [$carrot#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
Broccoli [$crops#Plant*] recorded generally low incidence of all four viruses or groups tested for, whilst [$cabbage#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] recorded very low incidence of CaMV only.
In the [$pea#Plant*] and [$broccoli#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] members of the [$Luteoviridae#Virus*] were the most prevalent viruses detected.
Samples that tested positive for generic [$Potyvirus#Virus*] and [$Luteoviridae#Virus*] tests were retested using [@virus specific antiserum and/or RTPCR#Method*].
[$Potyvirus#Virus*] detections (from [$pea#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*] in the first year of testing) were due to infection with [@Pea seed-borne mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@PSbMV#Virus*]).
These samples were all sourced from a single imported seed line.
Subsequent testing over the next two seasons failed to show evidence of [$PSbMV#Virus*] which may have been eliminated with destruction of the seed source.
Molecular analyses of a selection of Luteovirid isolates revealed most infections were due to [$Turnip yellows virus#Virus*] with five isolates from [$pea#Plant*] belonging to a putative novel [$Polerovirus#Virus*] species with closest homology to [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*].
