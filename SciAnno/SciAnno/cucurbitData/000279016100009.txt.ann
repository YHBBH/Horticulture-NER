Sixty-six [@watermelon#Plant*] ([$Citrullus lanatus var.lanatus#Plant*]) disease resistance gene analogs were cloned from 'Calhoun Gray', PI 296341, and PI 595203 using degenerate primers to select for the nucleotide binding sites (NBS) from the NBS-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) resistance gene family.
After contig assembly, [$watermelon#Plant*] resistance gene analogs (WRGA) were identified and amino acid sequence alignment revealed that these groups contained motifs characteristic of NBS-LRR resistance genes.
Using [$cluster analysis#Method*], eight groups of WRGA were identified and further characterized as having homology to Drosophila Toll and mammalian interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) and non-TIR domains.
Three of these WRGA as well as three disease-related [$watermelon#Plant*] expressed sequence tag homologs were placed on a test-cross map.
Linkage mapping placed the WRGA on linkage group XIII, an area on the [$watermelon#Plant*] map where resistance gene analogs cluster.
In addition, these WRGA sequence-tagged sites (STS) were amplified from various genera of the[$ Cucurbita#Plant*]ceae indicating that conservation of resistance gene analogs exists among [$cucurbits#Plant*].
These WRGA-STS markers may be useful in marker-assisted selection for the improvement for disease resistance in [$watermelon#Plant*].
