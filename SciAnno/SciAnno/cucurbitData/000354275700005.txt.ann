This study explored the pathways of ingress of [$Acidovorax citrulli#Virus*], the causal agent of [$bacterial fruit blotch of cucurbits#Disease*], into [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds.
Up until 7days post-inoculation (DPI), a significantly higher percentage of [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds was infected with [$A.citrulli #Virus*]when the bacteria were applied (c.
1x10(6)colony-forming units) to stigmas versus ovary pericarps of female flowers.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that, with stigma inoculation, [$A.citrulli #Virus*]colonized style and ovary tissues by 1 DPI, and the bacteria co-localized with pollen germ tubes in these tissues.
With ovary pericarp inoculation, [$A.citrulli #Virus*]cells penetrated the epicarp and mesocarp tissues by 1 DPI but did not reach endocarp until 4 DPI.
Finally, manual pollination followed by stigma inoculation led to >53% [$A.citrulli#Virus*]-infected seed lots, while [$A.citrulli #Virus*]was not detected in seeds/ovules generated by stigma inoculation without pollination (chemically induced parthenocarpy).
These results show that stigma inoculation results in faster colonization of [$watermelon#Plant*] ovules by [$A.citrulli #Virus*]than pericarp inoculation, even though there is no difference in the levels of infection in mature seeds.
The data also indicate that pollen germ tubes play an important role in [$A.citrulli #Virus*]ingress into [$watermelon#Plant*] seeds via stigmas.
