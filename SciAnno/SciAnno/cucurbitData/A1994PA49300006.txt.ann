[@ Cucurbit powdery mildew#Disease*] samples from Australian [$cucurbit #Plant*]production areas were assessed for their sensitivity to fungicides.
Resistance to benzimidazoles was highest (44%) followed by resistance to demethylation inhibitors (39%), organophosphates (21%), and hydroxypyrimidines (13%).
Many collections were resistant to more than one fungicide group.
Populations from rockmelon [$crops#Plant*] were more often resistant than those from less intensively managed [$pumpkin#Plant*] [$crops#Plant*].
There were also differences in the spectra of resistance between regions, in particular, a lower frequency of resistance to demethylation inhibiting fungicides in New South Wales (18%) than elsewhere (47%) and a high incidence of resistance to hydroxypyrimidines only in the Riverland-Swan Hill region (40%).
Such differences may be caused by variations in patterns of fungicide use.
The high frequency of fungicide resistance found in this survey illustrates the need for disease control programs to be implemented which are less reliant on the systemic fungicides.
