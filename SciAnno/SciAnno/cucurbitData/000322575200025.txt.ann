The main areas of field-grown cucurbit production in Panama were surveyed for the occurrence and distribution of viruses in the growing seasons of 2006 and 2008.
Notably, in 2006 only [@Melon necrotic spot virus#Virus*] ([$MNSV#Virus*]) was detected, while [$Papaya ringspot virus#Virus*] ([$PRSV#Virus*]) was the most frequent in 2008 in terms of number of fields and samples analysed, followed by [$Zucchini yellow mosaic virus#Plant*] ([$ZYMV#Virus*]), [$Watermelon mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$WMV#Virus*]) and [$MNSV#Virus*].
[$Cucumber mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$CMV#Virus*]), [$Squash mosaic virus#Virus*] ([$SqMV#Virus*]), [$Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus#Virus*] ([@CG-MMV#Virus*]), [$Tomato spotted wilt virus#Virus*] ([$TSWV#Virus*]), [@Cucumber leaf spot virus#Virus*] ([@CLSV#Virus*]), [$Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus#Virus*] ([$CYSDV#Virus*]), [$Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus#Virus*] ([$CABYV#Virus*]), [$Beet pseudo-yellows virus#Virus*] ([$BPYV#Virus*]), [@Beet yellows virus#Virus*] ([@BYV#Virus*]), and [$Cucumber vein yellowing virus#Virus*] ([$CVYV#Virus*]) were not detected.
Single and double ([$PRSV#Virus*]+[$WMV#Virus*]; [$PRSV#Virus*]+[$ZYMV#Virus*]; [$ZYMV#Virus*]+[$MNSV#Virus*]) infections were detected in 60% and 40% of the samples tested, respectively.
The occurrence and distribution of each virus varied according to the province and [$cucurbit species#Plant*].
