Monosporascus cannonballus is an important cucurbit root pathogen, which has been reported in the main production areas of melon and watermelon in Brazil and worldwide and potentially capable to colonize roots of different species.
Crop rotation is considered an effective management strategy to prevent this disease.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the response of different crops, pumpkin, cotton, cowpea, sesame, watermelon, melon, corn, cucumber, sorghum and tomato, to the infection of this pathogen.
Seedlings were transplanted into plastic containers with an inoculum concentration of 20 colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) of M.cannonballus.
Fifty days after transplanting, the variables analysed were the degree of disease severity on the root system and the frequency of reisolation.
On cucurbits, the results demonstrated different degrees of susceptibility among crops and cultivars, being melon and watermelon the most sensitive species.
In contrast, Cucurbita cultivars were the most tolerant.
Regarding non-cucurbit crops, maize, sorghum and tomato presented root discoloration and M.cannonballus was reisolated from roots.
Cotton, cowpea and sesame cultivars were not affected by the pathogen, so they can be considered as alternative crops to be cultivated, or in rotation with cucurbits, in M.cannonballus infested soils.
