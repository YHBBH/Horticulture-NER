Zucchini yellow fleck virus (ZYFV) is a polyvirus that occurs in cucurbits grown in some Mediterranean countries, 'Marketer' cucumber responded to ZYFV infection with a severe mosaic, stunting, and leaf and fruit deformation.
A high level of resistance to this virus was found in a single plant selection of 'Taichung Mon Gua' (TMG) cucumber from Taiwan.
In F-2 and backcross populations involving TMG x 'Marketer', the resistance to ZYFV was determined to be conferred by a single recessive gene, to which the symbol zyf is assigned.
