In recent years there has been an effort towards the development of genomic resources in several cucurbit species, mainly in melon, cucumber and watermelon.
The number of available sequences for these species in public databases has increased recently.
This has allowed the design of microarrays for transcriptome analysis and the discovery of SNP markers for genotyping.
Other genomic tools are also available in melon as BAC libraries, mutant populations and saturated genetic maps.
Some international initiatives have emerged that will probably lead to the sequencing of the complete genomes of some cucurbit species during the next years.
