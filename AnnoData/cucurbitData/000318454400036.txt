Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, remains to be one of the most important constraints in agricultural production worldwide.
However, reports showed that root-knot nematode population could be suppressed by the addition of organic amendments.
One of the methods for the control of root-knot nematode is the use of organic amendments, which have nematicidal effect.
The present investigation was carried out to evaluate organic amendments for the management of root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) infesting cucurbits in field condition during 2009-10 and 2010-11.
Various organic amendments viz., neem cake, castor cake and Jatropa cake were applied to the severely infested field 15 days before sowing @ 30 g/plant in randomized complete block design to the root zone of bitter gourd, bottle gourd and cucumber.
Observations on initial and final nematode population along with number of galls per plant were recorded.
The results indicated that in bitter gourd, neem cake performed well which recorded least number of galls (21.12 g/plant) and minimum nematode population (262.2 N/200 cc soil) compared to untreated control.
Whereas in untreated check, the number of galls was 129.6 g/plant with the population of 527.5 N/200 cc soil.
In bottle gourd, neem cake reduced number of galls (54.61 g/plant) and also reduced nematode population (350 N/200 cc) compared to untreated control with higher yield (18.03 t/ha).
Untreated control recorded highest nematode galls i.
e.
155.7 g/plant with highest population (1272 N/200 cc).
Neem cake treated fields showed higher B : C (1 : 2.48).
In cucumber, neem cake treated fields recorded least number of galls (61.66 g/plant), minimum nematode population (239.5 N/200 cc) with higher yield (11 t/ha), followed by jatropha and castor cakes, respectively.
Untreated check recorded highest galls (213.1 g/plant) with highest nematode population (541 N/200 cc) with lowest yield i.
e.
9.21 t/ha.
In total, on bitter gourd, bottle gourd and cucumber for the period of 2009-10 and 2010-11, the soil application of neem cake @ 30 g/plant reduced root knot nematode incidence and also increased yield.
