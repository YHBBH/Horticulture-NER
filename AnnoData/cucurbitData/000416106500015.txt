Cucurbits cultivation has great importance in the food industry.
However, in the main producing regions of curcubits, the increase of cultivation areas has been limited by viral infections.
Among the most prevalent viruses there is the Watermelon Mosaic Virus (WMV), Papaya Ringspot Virus (PRSV-W) and Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus (ZYMV).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reaction of watermelon genotypes (Crimson sweet and Charleston Gray) and pumpkin (Jacarezinho and Caserta) to isolate watermelon strains in the following cities: Palmas (PYP-12), Gurupi (PYG-14 and PYG-19), Formoso do Araguaia (PYF-6), and Porto Nacional (PyPn-36 and PyPn-39).
The experiment was performed in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design, with 5 testing plants for each repetition to measure the response of these strains to cucurbit genotypes.
The inoculated strains were obtained from leaves of watermelon cv Crinson sweet with symptoms The plants were rated by severity of viral symptoms in intervals of four days during 32 days.
It was verified that the cucurbit genotypes showed different susceptibility to the viral strains.
However, Caserta and Charleston gray were the ones which had greater sensitivity due to their high severity variation among the tested strains.
Thus, it can be observed that the reaction among strains depends on the host and this reaction can be antagonistic or synergistic, depending on the mixed infection.
Charleston gray watermelon was the most susceptible to most of the viral strains.
Thus, this cultivar should be avoided in these regions.
