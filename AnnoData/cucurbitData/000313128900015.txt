Improving germination of wax gourd [Benincasa hispida (Thunb.) Cogn.] seeds cultivar Fakkhiew by mechanical scarification was studied.
Scarifiying seeds by peeling the outer testa or peeling both the outer and inner testa significantly improved germination to more than 90% compared to that of non-scarified seeds (80%).
Scarification by cutting the edge of each seed also improved germination but favored fungal infection.
The scarification treatments significantly increased amylase activity, reducing sugar, and free fatty acid contents.
