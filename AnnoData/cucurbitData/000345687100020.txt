Seventeen pathogenic races were identified in axenic culture among 18 Czech isolates of Golovinomyces cichoracearum (Gc, six isolates) and Podosphaera xanthii (Px, 12 isolates) on a set of 21 melon cucurbit powdery mildew (CPM) race differentials and using a triplet septet code.
The 18 isolates were collected in 2010 from four cucurbit species: Cucurbita pepo (10 isolates), Cucurbita maxima (four isolates), Cucurbita moschata (two isolates) and Cucumis melo (one isolate).
The results of this research are interesting from several views.
One, the diversity for pathogenicity among the isolates of the two CPM pathogens on the melon CPM race differentials.
The pathogenic diversity of among these isolates confirmed that Czech CPM populations are unique, and highly variable in race structure.
There was no obvious relationship between source species and race identity for either CPM species.
Two, the concomitant reactions of the 21 melon differentials reveal a rich reservoir of potentially useful CPM resistance genes for pyramiding.
Three, the distinct differences in reactions by two pairs of closely related melon lines thought to be equivalent in their genes for resistance to Px emphasize the complexity of host plant resistance to CPM.
Differentials PI 234607, 'PMR 6', PI 124112, MR-1, and PI 124111 exhibited broad resistance to Gc and Px.
