'Charleston Belle', a root-knot nematode-resistant pepper (Capsicum annuum var.
annuum [Grossum Group]), and its susceptible recurrent parent, 'Keystone Resistant Giant', were Compared as spring crops for managing the southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) in fall-cropped cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and squash (Cucurbita pepo) at Blackville, SC and Tifton, GA.
'Charleston Belle' exhibited minimal root galling and nematode reproduction, and 'Keystone Resistant Giant' exhibited severe root galling and high nematode reproduction.
Cucumber grown in plots following 'Charleston Belle' had lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) root gall severity indices than following 'Keystone Resistant Giant' (4.2 versus 4.9, respectively).
Cucumber yields were 87% heavier (P less than or equal to 0.0001) and numbers of fruit were 85% higher (P less than or equal to 0.0001) in plots previously planted to 'Charleston Belle' than to 'Keystone Resistant Giant'.
Squash grown in plots following 'Charleston Belle' had lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) root gall severity indices than following 'Keystone Resistant Giant' (4.0 versus 4.8, respectively).
Squash yields were 55% heavier (P less than or equal to 0.01) and numbers of fruit were 50% higher (P less than or equal to 0.001) in plots previously planted to 'Charleston Belle' than to 'Keystone Resistant Giant'.
These results demonstrate that root-knot nematode-resistant bell pepper cultivars such as 'Charleston Belle' are useful tools for managing M.
incognita in double-cropping systems with cucurbit crops.
