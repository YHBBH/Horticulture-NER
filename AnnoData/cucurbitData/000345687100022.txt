Bacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas cucurbitae, was economically an insignificant disease in the United States until 2005.
But, in recent years, the disease occurred widely in pumpkin fields in the Midwest.
X.
cucurbitae caused leaf spot and fruit infection.
Leaf infection was observed from the time of spreading vines until harvest, and infection of fruit occurred from when fruit weights were 0.25 kg until harvest.
Field surveys were conducted during 2009-2011 to determine incidence of bacterial spot in commercial pumpkin fields in the Midwest.
In 2009, bacterial spot was observed in all 17 pumpkin fields visited in Illinois.
In 2010, a survey in Illinois showed that bacterial spot occurred in 40 of 50 commercial pumpkin fields with symptoms on 3 to 94% of fruit in a field (average 34%).
In 2011, a survey in the Midwestern states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin) showed fruit with bacterial spot symptoms in 95 of 111 pumpkin fields, with lesions on 3 to 98% of the fruit in a field (average 79%).
X.
cucurbitae was isolated from infected leaves and fruit.
The identity of the pathogen was confirmed by culturing on yeast extract-dextrose-CaCO3 agar, conducting biochemical and physiological tests, and using primers RST2 and RST3.
Koch's postulates for representative isolates were carried out on leaves of the pumpkin cv.
'Howden' in a greenhouse.
Koch's postulates for five of the isolates were also conducted in a field.
To determine a host-range of X.
cucurbitae, five isolates of the pathogen were mixed and inoculated onto leaves of 38 plant species in eight families (Cucurbitaceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Graminae, Leguminosae, Liliaceae, Solanaceae, Umbelliferae) that are commonly grown in crop rotation with cucurbits.
Only plant species in the family Cucurbitaceae developed typical symptoms of bacterial spot.
