Autotoxicity including population deterioration, regeneration failure and subsequent yield declines, are commonly observed in rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), other Cucurbit crops, tea tree (Camellia sinensis), horsetail wood (Casuarina equisetifolia) and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), in Southern China.
