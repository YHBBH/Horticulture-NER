RNA isolation from ripe fruit can be complicated by high concentrations of sugar and water.
These sugars interfere with RNA extraction often resulting in low RNA quality and quantities, and high water concentrations dilute the RNA, making isolation difficult.
We report a simple but novel method by which the majority of the excess sugar and water in mature fruit of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Matsum.
& Nakai], and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) can be easily removed from tissue before RNA extraction.
This method produced quality RNA in a shorter time than the currently accepted method for fruit tissue RNA isolation and does not require liquid nitrogen or a freeze dryer.
