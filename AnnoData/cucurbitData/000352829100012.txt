This study was performed to analyze genetic relationships of the four major cucurbitaceous crops including watermelon, melon, cucumber, and squash/pumpkin.
Among 120 EST-SSR primer sets selected from the International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative (ICuGI) database, PCR was successful for 51 (49.17%) primer sets and 49 (40.8%) primer sets showed polymorphisms among eight Cucurbitaceae accessions.
A total of 382 allele-specific PCR bands were produced by 49 EST-SSR primers from 24 Cucurbitaceae accessions and used for analysis of pairwise similarity and dendrogram construction.
Assessment of the genetic relationships resulted in similarity indexes ranging from 0.01 to 0.85.
In the dendrogram, 24 Cucurbitaceae accessions were classified into two major groups (Clade I and II) and 8 subgroups.
Clade I comprised two subgroups, Clade I-1 for watermelon accessions [I-la and I-1b-2: three wild-type watermelons (Citrullus lanatus var.
citroides Mats.
& Nakai), I-1b-1: six watermelon cultivars (Citrullus lanatus var.
vulgaris Schrad.)] and Clade 1-2 for melon and cucumber accessions [1-2a-1: 4 melon cultivars (Cucumis melo var.
cantalupensis Naudin.), I-2a-2: oriental melon cultivars (Cucumis melo var.
conomon Makino.), and I-2b: five cucumber cultivars (Cucumis sativus L.)].
Squash and pumpkin accessions composed Clade II {II-1: two squash/ pumpkin cultivars [Cucurbita moschata (Duch.
ex Lam.)/Duch.
& Poir.
and Cucurbita maxima Duch.] and II-2: two squash/pumpkin cultivars, Cucurbita pepo L./Cucurbita ficifolia Bouche.).
These results were in accordance with previously reported classification of Cucurbitaceae species, indicating that watermelon EST-SSRs show a high level of marker transferability and should be useful for genetic study in other cucurbit crops.
