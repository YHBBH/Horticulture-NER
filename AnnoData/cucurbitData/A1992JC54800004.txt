 Under controlled inoculation, a set of 56 accessions belonging to 19 wild species of the genus Cucumis was studied for resistance to seven isolates of cucurbit downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk.
et Curt.) Rostow.) from cucumber.
 No resistance to P.
cubensis was detected in these Cucumis accessions.
 In three host accession/pathogen isolate combinations, limited sporulation was observed.
 Nine new Cucumis species are described as hosts for P.
cubensis:  C.
africanus, C.
ficifolius, C.
figarei, C.
meeusii, C.
metuliferus, C.
myriocarpus, C.
leptodermis, C.
sagittatus and C.
zeyheri.
 Results are discussed in relation to the origin and evolution of Cucumis species.
