The objective of this study was to evaluate the physical and physiological changes of pumpkin seeds to grow 'Jacarezinho' conditions of the San Francisco River Valley during the maturation process.
The cultivation was carried out in this cucurbit vegetables experimental campus State University of Bahia, Juazeiro city, in the period from December 2010 to March 2011.
Seeds were harvested fruit at regular intervals, from 15 to 60 days after anthesis (DAA), whose work was installed in a randomized desing with six treatments (15, 25, 30, 40, 50 and 60 DAA) and four repetitions.
For each, season, fruit were assessed visually and determined the average weight, and the seeds extracted from fruits were evaluated for the following tests and/or regulations: water content, dry matter of seeds, germination, electrical conductivity, emergency and seedling, emergence speed index.
The seeds reached physiological maturity to 50 days after physiological, although the best time to begin the harvest fruit of this cultivar in the region is semiarid in the period from 50 to 60 days, when the seeds are less water content.
