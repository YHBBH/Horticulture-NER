BACKGROUNDLong-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLITNs) constitute a novel alternative that combines physical and chemical tactics to prevent insect access and the spread of insect-transmitted plant viruses in protected enclosures.
This approach is based on a slow-release insecticide-treated net with large hole sizes that allow improved ventilation of greenhouses.
The efficacy of a wide range of LLITNs was tested under laboratory conditions against Myzus persicae, Aphis gossypii and Bemisia tabaci.
Two nets were selected for field tests under a high insect infestation pressure in the presence of plants infected with Cucumber mosaic virus and Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus.
The efficacy of Aphidius colemani, a parasitoid commonly used for biological control of aphids, was studied in parallel field experiments.
   RESULTSLLITNs produced high mortality of aphids, although their efficacy decreased over time with sun exposure.
Certain nets excluded whiteflies under laboratory conditions; however, they failed in the field.
Nets effectively blocked the invasion of aphids and reduced the incidence of viruses in the field.
The parasitoid A.
colemani was compatible with LLITNs.
   CONCLUSIONLLITNs of appropriate mesh size can become a very valuable tool in combination with biocontrol agents for additional protection against insect vectors of plant viruses under IPM programmes.
