   Fluopicolide, a pyridinylmethyl-benzamide fungicide, was registered in the United States in 2008 to control diseases caused by Oomycete pathogens, such as Phytophthora capsici, on cucurbit and solanaceous vegetables.
The main objective of this study was to determine baseline sensitivity to fluopicolide in isolates of P capsici from the southeastern and midwestern United States.
A total of 69 isolates from Florida (14 isolates), Georgia (14 isolates), Michigan (24 isolates), North Carolina (3 isolates), and South Carolina (17 isolates) that had not been previously exposed to fluopicolide were grown on fungicide-amended medium to determine sensitivity of mycelia, sporangia, and zoospores to the fungicide.
All isolates of P capsici tested (range of 54 to 69 isolates per assay) were sensitive to fluopicolide in all four assays.
The median EC(50) fluopicolide concentration was 0.22, 2.08, 0.048, and 0.10 mg/liter in the mycelia] growth, zoospore germination, sporangia production, and zoospore production assays, respectively.
For mycelial growth and zoospore germination, isolates from Michigan had a higher mean EC(50) value than isolates from the four southeastern states.
This is the first report of variation in baseline sensitivity to a fungicide by P capsici isolates from different regions of the United States.
In the sporangia production and zoospore production assays, isolates from different states did not differ in sensitivity.
Single rates of fluopicolide were tested with additional isolates to validate discriminatory rates for monitoring sensitivity.
A concentration of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/liter is recommended for mycelial growth, and 0.1 mg/liter is recommended for sporangia and zoospore production.
