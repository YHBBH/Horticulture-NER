Seven traits related to flowering and sex expression in melon were studied and their reaction to application of two growth regulators (ethrel and gibberellic acid) was observed.
Four monoecious genotypes (Sesame, ED-3, ED-4, Pobeditel) and four andromonoecious genotypes (Chinese muskmelon, Anannas, Fiata, A2-3lb) had been used for experiments.
According to the results, ethrel had higher effects on the investigated traits than gibberellic acid.
Ethrel increased the number of perfect flowers per plant for 7.18 (31.42%), reduced the number of male flowers per plant for 21.47 (17.98%), affected earlier appearance of the first pistillate/perfect flower for 3.68 days, and delayed the appearance of the first staminate flower for 16.07 days.
Changes in the last two traits caused an extension of the period from the emergence of the first pistillate/perfect to the first staminate flower from 0.1 to 21.57 days, which represents the strongest effect of ethrel.
Gibberellic acid had generally opposite effects on the studied traits.
