Cytoplasmic male sterile system in ridge gourd has been converted to cytoplasmic genetic male sterile (CGMS) system through the development of analogues of male sterile (MS) line, maintainer line and fertility restorer line.
These lines were developed by crossing the MS mutant, regenerated through in vitro culture, with monoecious pollen parents Deepthi, Haritham, LA 101, CO 2, IC 92761 and IC 92685.
All hybrids and the BC1 generation developed by crossing with the recurring pollen parents Deepthi, Haritham and LA 101 were male sterile.
Male sterile BC1 plants have been advanced to BC6 generation and the parental line LA 101 was proved to be a successful maintainer line, producing male sterile progeny in successive back cross generations.
Analogue of cytoplasmic male sterile line, MS LA 101, was developed through back crossing and on crossing with fertility restorer lines Arka Sumeet and LA 102, this line excelled as female parent, resulting heterotic combinations.
Mitochondrial marker rpS14 and SCAR Tm-53 were identified to yield male sterility specific markers whereas SSR marker 18956 has generated the male fertility specific marker.
These primers are recommended for marker assisted selection of ridge gourd, for utilizing male sterility for hybrid seed production and for developing A, B and C lines in CGMS system.
