Melon yellow spot virus (MYSV) was previously reported from wax gourd in Thailand.
A survey of cantaloupe, cucumber, melon, pumpkin and watermelon plants was carried out to determine if MYSV occurred more widely in cucurbit species.
The survey revealed melon was mostly infected with MYSV.
In addition, MYSV was detected for the first time in pumpkin in Thailand.
