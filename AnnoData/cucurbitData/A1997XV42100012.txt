The genetic control of resistance to cucurbit aphid-borne yellows luteovirus (CAYW) in Cucumis melo L.
was studied in three progenies obtained from the cross between a resistant Indian line, PI 124112, and a susceptible cultivar of Charentais type, Vedrantais.
An F2 progeny and recombinant inbred lines were screened respectively in 1993 and 1995 under natural infection conditions in open field at Montfavet, France whereas the back cross (PI 124112 x F1) was inoculated by viruliferous Myzus persicae in controlled conditions.
ELISA was used for assessing degree of virus multiplication in the plants.
In the three trials performed, segregation analysis were consistent with the hypothesis that the resistance to CABYV in PI 124112 is conferred by two independent complementary recessive genes, for which the symbols cab-1 and cab-2 are proposed.
