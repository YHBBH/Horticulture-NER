More than 70 well-characterized virus species transmitted by a diversity of vectors may infect cucurbit crops worldwide.
Twenty of those cause severe epidemics in major production areas, occasionally leading to complete crop failures.
Cucurbit viruses' control is based on three major axes: (i) planting healthy seeds or seedlings in a clean environment, (ii) interfering with vectors activity, and (iii) using resistant cultivars.
Seed disinfection and seed or seedling quality controls guarantee growers on the sanitary status of their planting material.
Removal of virus or vector sources in the crop environment can significantly delay the onset of viral epidemics.
Insecticide or oil application may reduce virus spread in some situations.
Diverse cultural practices interfere with or prevent vector reaching the crop.
Resistance can be obtained by grafting for soil-borne viruses, by cross-protection, or generally by conventional breeding or genetic engineering.
The diversity of the actions that may be taken to limit virus spread in cucurbit crops and their limits will be discussed.
The ultimate goal is to provide farmers with technical packages that combine these methods within an integrated disease management program and are adapted to different countries and cropping systems.
