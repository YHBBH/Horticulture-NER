Cucurbits have great economic, nutritional and social importance in the Brazilian semiarid region.
In this region, many factors can result in reduced productivity of these crops, especially fungal and viral diseases.
Therefore, knowledge of cucurbits is crucial for proper disease management.
The objective of this work was to identify the major diseases of cucurbits grown in some municipalities in the Hinterland of the state of Pernambuco.
Thus, plant samples were collected with symptoms in crops in the municipalities of Salgueiro, Serra Talhada, Floresta, Petrolandia, Ibimirim, Custodia and Inaja.
A questionnaire was also applied to gather information about the production profile of producers.
Seven fungal pathogens infecting cucurbits were identified: Pseudoperonospora cubensis, Colletotrichum sp., Podosphaera xanthii, Rhizoctonia solani, Didymella bryoniae, Fusarium sp.
e Alternaria sp., and three viruses as well: Papaya ringspot virus - watermelon strain (PRSV-W), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV).
It was found that in small crops, there is limited search for technical information om cropping, and these crops originate mostly from native seeds, in contrast to medium and large producers, who use improved cultivars.
The melon and watermelon crops are the most commercially exploited, while pumpkins are used in subsistence agriculture.
As for plant health problems, most respondents reported knowing the main diseases that occur in crops and perform disease control based on personal experience and / or through the help of the technical assistance provided by agricultural stores.
In a few cases, in large farms, there was an agronomist to assist in this type of control.
