Management of cucumber fly (Bactrocera cucumis) has relied heavily on cover sprays of broad spectrum insecticides such as dimethoate and fenthion.
Long term access to these insecticides is uncertain, and their use can disrupt integrated pest management programs for other pests such as whitefly, aphids and mites.
Application of a protein bait spray for fruit fly control is common practice in tree crops.
However, vegetable crops present different challenges as fruit flies are thought to enter these crops only to oviposit, spending the majority of their time in roosting sites outside of the cropping area.
Perimeter baiting of non-crop vegetation was developed overseas as a technique for control of melon fly (B.
cucurbitae) in cucurbits in Hawaii.
More recent work has refined the technique further, with certain types of perimeter vegetation proving more attractive to melon fly than the sorghum or corn crops which are commonly utilised.
Trials were performed to investigate the potential of developing a similar system for cucumber fly.
Commercially available fruit fly baits were compared for attractiveness to cucumber fly.
Eight plant species were evaluated for their relative attractiveness to cucumber flies as roosting sites.
Differences were observed in the number of flies feeding at protein bait applied to each of the plants.
Results are discussed in the context of the development of a perimeter baiting system for cucumber fly in cucurbit crops.
