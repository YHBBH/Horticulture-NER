The complete coat protein (cp) gene sequence of eighty Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-[potato] (ToLCNDV-[potato]) isolates collected from eleven states were determined.
Phylogenetic analysis based on cp gene grouped the isolates into two major clades (I & II) and they shared 95.9-100.0% identity.
The DNA A and DNA B of eight representative isolates (six from clade I and two from clade II) were 2739-2740 and 2692-2694 nts long and shared 94.6-99.4% and 97.2-99.5% homology within the isolates, respectively.
Among the eight isolates, the DNA A of two isolates (Clade II), GWA-5 and FAI-19 had 94.6-95.3% sequence identity to other six isolates and formed a subclade within the ToLCNDV-[potato] isolates.
Similar grouping was also revealed with AC1 and AC4 genes of these eight isolates.
The DNA A components shared more than 90.0% identity with the DNA A of ToLCNDV isolates from cucurbitaceous crops, tomato, bhendi, 89.0-90.0% with ToLCNDV-papaya isolates and 70.4-74.0% with other tomato leaf curl viruses.
Hence, the begomovirus infecting potatoes are the ToLCNDV isolates, designated as ToLCNDV-[potato].
Whereas, the DNA B components shared 86.6-91.7% identity with ToLCNDV isolates from cucurbits, tomato and bhendi.
Evidence for intra-species recombination was detected only in DNA A with a maximum of three events in GWA-5 and FAI-19 isolates.
Analysis of cp gene, DNA A, iterons and recombination events clearly indicate that two groups of ToLCNDV-[potato] infects potato in India.
