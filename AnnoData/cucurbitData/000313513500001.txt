Many cucurbits have historically been used as both nutrition and medicine.
The specific compounds present in cucurbits are in the process of being identified and used in studies for alleviation of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular events, and some forms of cancer.
Watermelon is a cucurbit studied for germplasm, horticultural, and health effects, especially in reference to lycopene and citrulline.
Germplasm is the primary factor affecting lycopene content, while genetic and horticultural aspects affecting citrulline content are much less clear.
Synergy, where a mixture of compounds having specific disease prevention have enhanced effectiveness when combined with non-specific compounds, is the next challenge in developing targeted disease prevention through dietary changes.
