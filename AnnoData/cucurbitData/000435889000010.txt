Powdery mildew (PM) is a major foliar disease causing serious economic losses of cucurbit crops grown in the United States.
The pathogen Podosphaera xanthii, which causes PM, is known to infect seedlings, stems, foliage, petioles, and fruit of cucurbit crops.
In recent years, grafting watermelon on resistant rootstocks for managing soilbome diseases has been gaining popularity in the U.S.A.
However, grafting for managing foliar diseases has not yet received adequate attention.
Three greenhouse experiments were conducted during the summer months of 2012, 2013, and 2014 to determine if PM-resistant rootstocks could impart resistance to a susceptible watermelon scion.
Susceptible watermelon scion 'Mickey Lee' seedlings were grafted onto 25 watermelon (Citrullus lanatus, C.
amarus, C.
mucosospennus) and four bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) rootstocks.
Grafted plants were inoculated with a 2 x 10(4) conidia ml(-1) suspension of P.
xanthii conidia and disease severity was rated 14 days after inoculation.
Mickey Lee grafted on six PM-resistant watermelon rootstocks had significantly (P <= 0.05) lower PM severity on cotyledons, 2nd true leaf, and upper leaves (rating for 3rd to 7th or 8th true leaf) compared with Mickey Lee grafted on susceptible watermelon USVL677-PMS or bottle gourd USVL848-PMS rootstocks.
However, some of the resistant watermelon rootstocks did not impart significant resistance to the scion.
The resistant bottle gourd rootstocks USVL482-PMR and USVL351-PMR provided significantly greater levels of resistance, compared with many of the resistant watermelon rootstocks.
Grafting watermelon on resistant rootstocks may help mitigate the effects of PM on susceptible scion seedlings.
