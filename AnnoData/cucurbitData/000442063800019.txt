Interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x C+ moschara 'Strong Tosa') and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria 'Macis') rootstocks are resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum but susceptible to Meloidogyne incognita (Southern root-knot nematode).
Coinfection of Early Prolific Straightneck summer squash (C.
pepo) with root-knot nematode and F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum has been reported to increase susceptibility to Fusarium wilt.
The objectives of this study were to determine whether such an interaction occurred between M.
incognita and F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum races I and 2 on Strong Tosa, Macis, and watermelon cultivars Fascination (resistant to race 1) and Tri-X 313 (susceptible to both races).
Hosts were inoculated in a greenhouse with one of four pathogen treatments: F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum, M.
incognita, both pathogens, or neither pathogen.
Galling was present on >= 10% of the root systems of 90% of the plants inoculated with M.
incognita.
Bottle gourd had less galling than interspecific hybrid squash.
Plants not inoculated with F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum did not wilt.
Four weeks after inoculation, incidence and severity of Fusarium wilt and recovery of F.
oxysporum did not differ for any hosts inoculated with F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum alone and F.
oxysporum f, sp.
niveum plus M.
incognita (host treatment interactions not significant).
In general, Early Prolific Straightneck grouped with the F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum-resistant rootstocks when inoculated with F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum race 2 and with the susceptible watermelon when inoculated with race 1, regardless of inoculation with M.
incognita.
Recovery of F.
oxysporum from stems of inoculated watermelon was greater than recovery from the other three hosts, regardless of nematode inoculation.
In conclusion, our experiments do not support the hypothesis that resistance to F.
oxysporum f.
sp.
niveum in cucurbit rootstocks or resistant watermelon cultivars would be compromised when M.
incognita infects the roots.
