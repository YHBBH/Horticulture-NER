Two methods for the detection of Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV) on infected plants were developed, based on the information provided by cDNA clones covering the 3'-end of the genome of a Spanish isolate (CVYV-AILM).
The sequenced portion of the CVYV-AILM genome showed a 96.6% aminoacid identity with that of a reported sequence of another CVYV isolate from Israel ( Lecoq et al., 2000).
The first detection method used a RNA specific probe for hybridization with nucleic acids extracted from infected plants.
The probe was complementary to a portion of the CVYV genome including the C-terminal part of the NIb and most of the coat protein ( CP) coding regions.
The second detection method employed polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant viral CP expressed in bacteria.
The specific antibodies were used to detect the presence of virus particles in plant extracts.
Both procedures resulted in a highly specific detection of CVYV in plants infected with different isolates of the virus.
No interference was observed with other cucurbit-infecting viruses.
Sensitivities achieved were sufficient for routine diagnosis of the presence of the virus in plants.
