 Purified cucurbitacin B and E act as feeding stimulants for the red pumpkin beetle, but on testing three pairs of isogenic bitter (Bi) and non-bitter (bi) lines of cucumber, no relationship was found to exist between the bitter gene and the degree of damage caused by this beetle.
In summer squash, both resistant and susceptible lines contain cucurbitacin at the susceptible plant growth stage (cotyledon) but there was no correlation between the quantity of total phenols, free amino acids or reducing sugars in this material and resistance.
Bitter gourd, which has cucurbitacin in the cotyledons, was not preferred by the beetle.
