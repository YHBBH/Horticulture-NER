The first SSR-based genetic linkage map of C.
moschata was created by integrating the maps of two F, populations with one common parent developed from the crosses Waltham Butternut (WB) x Nigerian Local (NL) and ZHOU (a hull-less type) x WB.
This integrated C.
moschata map comprises 205 SSR markers and 2 morphological traits (Gr and n).
The map is composed of 27 linkage groups with a marker density of 7 cM.
Comparison of the C.
moschata map and the published C.
pepo map revealed a high level of macro-synteny.
Seventy-one common SSR markers between C.
moschata and C.
pepo are located in homologous linkage groups.
These markers representing orthologous loci in general have conserved orders and similar genetic distances.
Four SSR markers were mapped in non-homologous linkage groups.
They may represent different members of multi-gene families, chromosomal rearrangements and paralogs.
The comparative mapping of C.
moschata and C.
pepo reported here will be useful for further studies on Cucurbit evolution, gene isolation, and breeding
