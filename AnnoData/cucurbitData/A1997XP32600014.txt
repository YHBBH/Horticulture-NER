Inbred lines derived from the Chinese cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivar, 'Taichung Mou Gua' (TMG), have been shown to be resistant to several potyviruses including: zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), zucchini yellow fleck virus (ZYFV), watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) and the watermelon strain of papaya ringspot virus (PRSV-W).
Recently, an additional virus that infects cucurbits, the Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus (MWMV), has been determined to be a distinct member of the potyvirus group.
This study demonstrates that TMG-1 possesses resistance to MWMV.
Rub or aphid inoculated TMG-1 seedlings remain free of symptoms.
Progeny analyses of the F-1, F-2 and backcross generations show that resistance to MWMV is conferred by a single recessive gene (proposed designation, mwm).
Sequential inoculation of progeny possessing resistance to ZYMV followed by MWMV (or MWMV followed by ZYMV) and analysis of F-3 families derived from F-2 individuals selected for resistance to ZYMV indicate that both resistances are conferred by the same gene, or two tightly linked genes.
