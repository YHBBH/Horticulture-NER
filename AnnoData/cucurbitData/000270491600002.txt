Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an excellent model species for the Study of functional genomics in the Cucurbitaceae, a plant family that includes melon, cucumber.
watermelon, and squash, because Of its unique traits such as a lianous structure of the plant body and unusual mode of sex determination.
Following the first workshop on Cucurbit genomics in Barcelona in 2005, the International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative (ICuGI: http://www.icugi.org/) was established at an academic level, and melon became the model Species for cucurbit stud as a result of existing genomic resources for this species.
The ICuGI is currently overseeing three projects concerned with the development of research tools for functional genomics in melon: sequencing of ESTs, merging of existing melon genetic maps, and development of an ICuGI webpage containing specific genomic tools available to the cucurbit research community.
Additional efforts are also underway to develop tools for the study of melon functional genomics.
Availability of these resources will promote research activities in the Cucurbitaceae, especially melon.
This review summarizes the current status of these tools and discusses future aspects of the study of melon functional genomics.
