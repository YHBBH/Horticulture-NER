Watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum & Nakai cv.
Sugar Baby, were grown in the field as a fall crop in open-top chambers (OTC) in southwestern Indiana with either charcoal-filtered (CF) or nonfiltered (NF) air.
 Ozone and sulfur dioxide were continuously monitored in OTC and ambient air.
 There was a significant decrease in marketable yield by weight (19.9%, P = 0.05), percentage of marketable fruit by number (20.8%, P = 0.10), and total yield by weight (21.5%, P = 0.05) from plants grown in the NF air treatment compared with those grown in CF air.
 Ozone-induced foliar injury was significantly greater on plants grown under NF conditions.
 Ambient concentrations of O3 in southwestern Indiana caused foliar injury (P = 0.10) and significant yield loss to a fall crop of watermelons.
