Combining population genetics with epidemiology provides insight into the population biology of pathogens, which could lead to improved management of plant diseases.
Gummy stem blight, caused by three closely related species of Stagonosporopsis-Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum (syn.
Didymella bryoniae), S.
citrulli, and S.
caricae-is a devastating disease of cucurbits worldwide.
Sources of inoculum for epidemics, mechanisms of dispersal, and the mating system of these species are not well understood.
To improve our knowledge of gummy stem blight epidemiology, we developed 18 polymorphic microsatellite markers by combining microsatellite motif enrichment with next-generation sequencing.
When tested on 46 isolates from diverse cucurbit hosts and regions, the markers were robust for the dominant and widely distributed S.
citrulli.
Within this species, we found no population structure based on broad-scale geographic region or host of origin.
Using the microsatellites, a rapid polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed to distinguish the three morphologically similar species causing gummy stem blight.
To better understand dispersal, reproduction, and fine-scale genetic diversity of S.
citrulli within and among watermelon fields, 155 isolates from two field populations in Georgia, United States were genotyped with the 18 microsatellite loci.
Although dominant and widespread clones were detected, we found relatively high genotypic diversity and recombinant genotypes consistent with outcrossing.
Significant population genetic structure between the two field populations demonstrated that there is regional geographic structure and limited dispersal among fields.
This study provides insight into the fine-scale genetic diversity and reproductive biology of the gummy stem blight pathogen S.
citrulli in the field.
