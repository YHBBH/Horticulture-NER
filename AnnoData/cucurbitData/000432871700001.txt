Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was detected in samples of cucurbit seed lots intended for entry into Australia for purposes of sowing.
CGMMV was detected in 22 of 631 (3.5%) samples tested in 2016; the virus was detected in seeds of cucumber (8 of 102 samples; 7.8%), melon (13 of 393; 3.3%) and watermelon (1 of 57; 1.8%).
Virus was found in seed lots identified as originating from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North, Central and South America.
Exclusion of CGMMV from national entry is an important element of Australia's program of official control for the virus.
